From the data we generated in mouse sorted OSNs, we see that Ace2 is enriched in the WOM vs OSNs, meaning that while it is also expressed in OSNs, it is expressed at overall lower levels.

SARS, as I understand it, is not glycosylation-dependent in its entry (although the spike protein itself is glycosylated). Also there are def. mouse coronaviruses that can infect the olfactory epithelium (SDAV, MHVs), so the presence of mucin is not a uniform shield against infection.

Abstract
Observational data on COVID-19 including hypothesised risk factors for infection and progression are accruing rapidly. Here, we highlight the challenge of interpreting observational evidence from non-random samples of the population, which may be affected by collider bias. We illustrate these issues using data from the UK Biobank in which individuals tested for COVID-19 are highly selected for a wide range of genetic, behavioural, cardiovascular, demographic, and anthropometric traits. We discuss the sampling mechanisms that leave aetiological studies of COVID-19 infection and progression particularly susceptible to collider bias. We also describe several tools and strategies that could help mitigate the effects of collider bias in extant studies of COVID-19 and make available a web app for performing sensitivity analyses. While bias due to non-random sampling should be explored in existing studies, the optimal way to mitigate the problem is to use appropriate sampling strategies at the study design stage.",message,

Dear all,
During the last years, our group has established different workflows based on olfactory proteomics. We use mass-spectrometry &amp; System Biology  approaches to decipher disrupted molecular mechanisms at olfactory level in different biological contexts. If someone is interested in the deployment of these technological workflows and sed new light about the effects triggered by SARS-CoV-2 at olfactory level, our lab would be glad to be a potential partner, collaborate and contribute to the relation between smell loss &amp; Covid-19 from a molecular point of view.

Abstract
COVID-19 patients may exhibit neuropsychiatric and/or neurological symptoms. We found that anxiety and cognitive impairment are manifested by 28-56% of SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals with mild or no respiratory symptoms and are associated with altered cerebral cortical thickness. Using an independent cohort, we found histopathological signs of brain damage in 19% of individuals who died of COVID-19. All of the affected brain tissues exhibited foci of SARS-CoV-2 infection, particularly in astrocytes. Infection of neural stem cell-derived astrocytes changed energy metabolism, altered key proteins and metabolites used to fuel neurons and for biogenesis of neurotransmitters, and elicited a secretory phenotype that reduces neuronal viability. Our data support the model where SARS-CoV-2 reaches the brain, infects astrocytes and triggers neuropathological changes that contribute to the structural and functional alterations in the brain of COVID-19 patients.",message,

Abstract
Introduction: The course of anosmia and ageusia in COVID-19 patients is not yet clearly known. We present short-term follow-up data concerning mild to moderate disease in home-quarantined COVID-19 patients in Greece.

Methods: We provided a symptom questionnaire and instructions for a self-administered home smell-and-taste test to 79 positive COVID-19 patients from 2 tertiary hospitals in Greece. The patients recorded their subjective symptoms before and during infection as well as 4 weeks after the diagnosis. The patients also underwent the home test during infection and 4 weeks later.

Results: Twenty-nine patients (36.7%) reported a loss of smell, and 21 (27.8%) reported a loss of taste, with equal prevalences between genders. We observed 2 types of recovery, i.e., a rapid, almost complete recovery, and a second slower and partial recovery. The type of recovery was not age related. A rapid recovery was observed in two thirds of the patients, with their olfactory ratings presenting a trend towards significance in correlation with nasal obstruction. A slow recovery in olfaction was correlated with low intensity ratings in odors with a trigeminal compound. The loss of taste was more pronounced in sweet and salty intensity ratings.

Conclusion: Chemosensory deficits associated with COVID-19 infection were quite frequent among the Greek patients with mild or moderate disease who, in most cases, returned to normal within 4 weeks. However, 1 in 3 patients presented with persistent olfactory and gustatory dysfunction in the short term.",message,

Abstract
Objectives: The multifaceted manifestation of COVID-19 requires longitudinal characterization of symptoms, to aid with screening and disease management. Methods: Phone interviews and follow-ups were completed with 112 mostly mild COVID-19 RT-PCR-positive adult patients, over a six-months period. Results: More than one symptom at disease onset was experienced by ~70% of the patients. About 40% of the patients experienced fever, dry cough, headache, or muscle ache as the first symptom. Fatigue, if reported, usually was the first to appear. Smell and taste changes were experienced 3.9 ± 5.4 and 4.6 ± 5.7 days (mean ± SD) after disease onset and emerged as first symptom in 15% and 18% of patients, respectively. Fever had the shortest duration (5.8 ± 8.6 days), and taste and smell changes were the longest-lasting symptoms (17.2 ± 17.6 and 18.9 ± 19.7 days, durations censored at 60 days). Longer smell recovery correlated with smell change severity. Cough, taste change and smell change persisted after negative RT-PCR tests (in 20%, 26% and 29% of the patients in total). At six-months follow-up, 46% of the patients had at least one unresolved symptom, most commonly fatigue (21%), chemosensory changes (14%) or breath difficulty (9%). Conclusions: More than one symptom typically occurred at disease onset. Chemosensory changes and cough persisted after negative RT-PCR in a quarter of the patients. Almost half of the patients reported at least one unresolved symptom at six-months follow up, mainly fatigue, smell changes and breath difficulty. Our findings highlight the prevalence of long-lasting effects of COVID-19. <https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.25.20201343>",message,

U010MRTQM3Q,basic-science,2020,11,11,2020-11-11,"The key finding here is that the timing of functional loss matches Sus/stem cell infection - they see (but don’t quantify) OSN infection at Day 4, a timepoint at which the mice have already recovered their sense of smell; this argues that causality for anosmia doesn’t run through OSN death in the most common, reversible cases.

U010UTDM4HE,basic-science,2020,11,11,2020-11-11,"I agree <@U010MRTQM3Q>. And that is very interesting hypothesis. In the paper it says the viral load was still high at 4dpi. The virus was detected in the sustentacular cells and Bowman gland and stem cells, like in your previous paper, and they found virus in the cilia of OSNs at 4dpi. There is certainly a possibility that the OSNs were at process of dying.  It is also a very interesting hypothesis that, in case of the patients, the first anosmia starts when invasion of virus to the sus/B/stem cells started and, if the viral load is not high and did not kill OSNs, they may recover their sense rather fast. And if the OSNs died after several days later, it takes longer time to recover from anosmia. I think, in this mice experiments, it is nice to test at several time points for longer time span, and see, if the OSNs died, how long it takes to recover.",message,

I am wondering if it is possible to use your method to determine the chemical constituents of, for example, essential oils that are most contributing to the smell. There are major chemical constituents already determined by GC/MS analyses, but I wonder if the major ones are really the ones that determine how they smell. Most likely they are, but I heard in some cases the amount does not explain the responses.

U010UTDM4HE,basic-science,2020,11,17,2020-11-17,"Thank you so much <@U010MRTQM3Q>!! This is very interesting... I was wondering what causes the time differences in the activation of glomeruli. Whether the chemicals with larger MW is slower in reaching to the OSNs and slower in activating the glomeruli. Or, if the suppression at the OSNs (reported by Xu et al. 2020; Firestein group in Science 2020, ease5390) generates the time differences in the glomeruli (but this is based on the assumption that the suppressed OSN responds with delay). The final smell seems to be defined by the chemical compound, the suppression/enhancement at the OSNs, the order of activation of the glomeruli,,,",message,
U0108SFEJ4T,basic-science,2020,11,17,2020-11-17,"Minor comment on <@U010MRTQM3Q>: Dayu Lin did this experiment analyzing neural data, not behavior. I guess you are asking about the behavioral relevance of different components.
This is a very important question, that drives most of my work. However, we still did not figure out how to do this experiments with odors. The main difficulty is interpretation of animal behavior.  We tried to train an animal on a mixture, versus many other odor, and then modify the mixture content. The result depends on selection of other odors...   We are still working on it.",message,

I would expect central non-encephalitic degenerative effects to be slower. Volume of the OB might not be changed on a scan, but signs of early degeneration might be detectable post mortem. If this happens, it is possible there could be a looming delayed onset dementia like syndrome. A lot of steps have to happen for this to be true - virus has to get into cortex (likely via OB), degeneration has to occur, and virus has to cross synapses or migrate in another way into the limbic system.

The ideas that I have in mind require extensive data collection, so we might wait on them for a bit. But review is good first step. A quick pubmed search shows nothing on taste/smell and COVID-19.

Given the prevalence of these symptoms, and uptick in media attention, clinicians and scientists will be seeking information.  The tentative angle I was thinking was that in these early stages, there should be a source of information 1-2 paper's that could help bring them up to speed on what we know from SARS, other similar virus's, and preliminary COVID data. Hopefully this would help as a good jumping off point for further work, and at the least we would have a repository of resources.
Once more COVID data comes in, then I was thinking a more specific work on meta-analysis, etc, as well as the specific reviews mentioned (obesity, cancer, chronic conditions )",message,

Interesting paper Tristram - the review that they cite seems to be particularly systematic as they missed our JAMA series, although it was published within the time scale of other papers (<https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2765183>). What's most interesting is how to evaluate the data in studies looking at those with both positive and negative cohorts based on PCR. For example, 22% of the PCR - cohort in the COVID symptom tracker study had anosmia, but if we assume a 30% false negative rate its quite likely that a lot of these were actually positive. Only combined PCR and reliable serology testing will really allow us to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of anosmia as a marker.",message,

As we have seen in recent weeks, the scientific literature regarding COVID-19 is exploding. With both pre-prints and peer-reviewed publications coming out daily, it is hard to keep on top of it all. This is even true for those papers focused on the chemical senses. To help each other stay on top of the most relevant literature, we suggest collecting relevant publications in a shared and tagged bibliography which has been created. This library will also be used as PDF repository for all past chemosensory papers to give access to those with paywalls so be sure to add these as well.

If you want to be included, add your email to <https://drive.google.com/open?id=1e-SkoXUfLvXekRsIr342Wq7PhgB5qehCkroEkGYzYak|this spreadsheet>. Also, check out the <https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Eb1QkQeWWjZfflwvz6KBKumYHcrlFcg8Lpyl0F6x1tg|Zotero user guide>.

 You indicated in the skills database that you are interested in contributing to the weekly literature digest (thank you!), so I’ve taken the liberty to join you to this channel and to tag you in this post with three concrete actions you can help us with each time you come across a new relevant paper regarding chemical senses &amp; covid-19:

1.     If you actually read the paper, write a short summary for the “weekly literature digest” in this document. As the name suggests, this is a little digest we offer each week to the membership in the <#C01073JSVLZ|key_announcements> channel to help everyone keep up to date with important and interesting papers. They can be entered in this document: <https://docs.google.com/document/d/10e2VY3fTpkhX3mnXGSFMJY9gxI9j_S5Vi22aEkJqC5w/edit?usp=sharing>
<@U010YJ39EMS> has been doing a fantastic job with these so far and she can probably use some assistance from you and I would like to ask her to guide you along.
These are the sections for each paper
&gt; Title:
&gt; (1) Date
&gt; of publication online of the paper : 
&gt; (2) Link
&gt; to the paper: 
&gt; (3) the
&gt; principal approach: 
&gt; (4) the
&gt; main findings: 
&gt; (5) Why
&gt; you think the paper is notable (is it a particularly strong paper? Are there
&gt; serious weaknesses we should be aware of? How does it relate to past or future
&gt; GCCR papers/projects?) 
2.     List the paper in this channel <#C010E0X35C2|chemosensory_lit-review>. When posting helpful publication URL links, PLEASE always _also_ copy and paste the full publication info as text: 
&gt; Authors, date, title, journal, doi - basically the text that pubmed or MedrXv /BioXrv give.  Eg. Relationship between odor intensity estimates and COVID-19 prevalence prediction in a Swedish population
&gt;  Behzad Iravani,    Artin Arshamian,    Aharon Ravia,    Eva Mishor,    Kobi Snitz,    Sagit Shushan,    Yehudah Roth,    Ofer Perl,    Danielle Honigstein,    Reut Weissgross  <https://academic.oup.com/chemse/advance-article/doi/10.1093/chemse/bjaa034/5842049?searchresult=1|... Show more>
&gt;  _Chemical Senses_, bjaa034, <https://doi.org/10.1093/chemse/bjaa034>
3.     Add it to our Shared GCCR Zotero library. This library is already incredibly useful, but it needs continuous work:
&gt; adding new papers, 
&gt; replacing preprints with published citations, 
&gt; figuring out good tags, 
&gt; tagging etc. 
<https://gccr-mql6351.slack.com/team/U010XM0J9Q8|@Bob Pellegrino> is the admininstrator of the shared GCCR Zotero library.

U010KDF9AVD,chemosensory_lit-review,2020,07,31,2020-07-31,"Hi Literature buffs, <!channel>

I feel like the literature on the topic of chemosensory loss and COVID-19 has reached a sweet spot where we can refer to a few papers and give a good overview to interested readers on the webpage (where our list was hopelessly outdated). Initially there were so few papers, we could just list all. Then there were so many papers, that it made no sense to try to keep up. But now there are reviews and meta-analyses and it seems like we could give a shorter list that is not going to be outdated within a week.

I would like to ask for your assistance with this. Please suggest papers. If you want to add a little explanation, even better.

*Audience:* webpage visitors. Could be scientists, journalists, survey responders, random lay people. This is not specifically for patients and we are working with patient advocates for something for them.

*Content:* 
Headings for a topic with a list of 2-3 scientific papers and one popular press article. Preferably high level reviews and meta-analyses. Possibly one sentence introduction for each paper if more clarification is useful.

*Proposed headings;*

Chemosensory loss and COVID-19

Causes of chemosensory loss and COVID-19

Chemosensory loss as a diagnostic for COVID-19

Coping with chemosensory loss

Special Issue: Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on food intake, appetite and weight status



*Special Issue:*
Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on food intake, appetite, and weight status.
*Guest Editors:*
Prof Marion Hetherington and Dr Stuart Flint
*Aims and scope of the Special Issue*
The global pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and subsequent efforts to protect populations from infection through self-isolation, quarantine and lockdown has had a profound effect on food intake. Effects have ranged from changes in basic accessibility and availability of food to the experience of food insecurity during lockdown; direct effects of developing COVID-19 on vulnerable groups including older adults as well as indirect effects on children, families and communities. Research has shown a light on the many and diverse changes that the pandemic has caused in the way we eat as well as what and how much is eaten.
The aim of this special issue is to disseminate papers which have investigated the impact which the COVID-19 pandemic has had on any aspect of the cultural, social, psychological, sensory and physiological factors determining the selection and intake of foods and drinks. Papers are welcome which present research drawn from observational, experimental, and/or trial-based approaches, and applying methods which are qualitative, quantitative or mixed.
Manuscripts will be handled through the normal, rigorous review process, but the timeline will be expedited to ensure that important findings are published in response to the urgent need for more data in this field. The special issue will be coordinated by Professor Marion Hetherington, University of Leeds and guest edited by Dr Stuart Flint, President of Scaled Insights and Associate Professor, University of Leeds.
Papers are invited NOW for September/October 2020 publication dates.

AND BOY do we need more communication (hard to believe, I know, with this unwieldy chaotic Slack, but yes, we still need more communication).

I'm going to be honest, there is so much going on that I even have a hard time figuring out what we need.

So here is a really good chance to step up and not just help us with what we know needs to be done, but also if you think you know how to things better :grin:

I think it  would make more sense to set up a sheet in excel or google docs with the fields we want in the order that we want them.  It would make it easier to upload to the website and to search and change. I'd also suggest that we send our request once via email (with the explanation of why we want the info) as we want to capture the people who aren't active on Slack.

U010KDF9AVD,comm_social_media,2020,07,23,2020-07-23,"<!channel>, yesterday we had a meeting about what we want to do with social media. So far we have used the GCCR account mostly for notifications of the launch of our research tools, with the goal of participant recruitment. This is something we will continue, but we want to do more, so we discussed what and how.

:loudspeaker: *Constraints without reducing creativity*
Social media thrives on spontaneous interactions, but can also easily create wrong messages. We want you to be creative, but these are the sensitivities that need to be kept in mind:
1. study recruitment materials will be composed by a special team (from that project and/or leadership and/or press experts) and should not be changed. This is because the message will influence who responds and that will influence selection bias and research quality
2. study results will also be composed by a special team, (same as #1), because communicating this in an insensitive manner can be harmful. For example, if we say that olfactory performance is predictive of COVID-19, that would be harmful for those with pre-existing olfactory dysfunction, when it seems to be self-reported sudden loss of smell that is predictive. The nuance matters a lot here and the people directly responsible for the results would be best at describing them. 
3. jokes/memes/gifs etc. these can be fun but also unintentionally harmful. Sarcasm for example is hard to communicate online and is not universally considered funny. We cannot use materials created by others without permission or appropriate attribution. Thread very carefully when it comes to these things and consult with other members whenever you have an inkling of doubt and/or communicate with leadership team,  <@U010KDF9AVD> is the leadership liaison for this and you can always ask. 
*Audiences*
We have a couples of obvious audiences on social media that we can direct different kinds of messages to.
1. study participants. This is kind of straightforward. We have pre-composed messages, but these need to be tweeted regularly (single tweet effect for recruitment is max 24 hours in my experience) and retweeted within language networks.
2. general public. It is good to raise awareness of research on the chemical senses and chemosensory dysfunction specifically. We have a great opportunity here, because anosmia is something that people have now heard of and are interested in
3. patients with chemosensory dysfunction. We know a few things about this and the patients are very interested in finding out more and there isn't that much available. They may follow GCCR to learn more
4. Other GCCR members. Slack is hard to engage with. Social media messages may function as a method to keep other members up to date and to draw inactive members in.
5. Other scientist, clinicians, patient advocates and other stakeholders as prospective GCCR members. We are welcoming to more members, and value diversity. Social media can help us reach beyond our usual networks. 
6. Media. Journalists and writers are on social media and can use our content to find materials for their work. This will benefit our mission. 
...
Please add in replies if you think we missed some potential audiences and why they are important to consider.

*Content*
In a post above we already had some suggested content domains and we can easily use multiple people contributing to various domains.
In addition to posting new research studies and recruitment materials here are some things we definitely want to do:
• post more about chemical senses in general. What is chemesthesis for example?!? What is phantosmia? 
• post more about other relevant research, particularly from other GCCR members
• posts highlighting members
• post about process and consortium itself. ",message,
U010KDF9AVD,comm_social_media,2020,07,23,2020-07-23,"
*What generally works* :camera: :speaking_head_in_silhouette:
*Images.* Any post should have some image and we have some available from the GCCR. *Personal stories* always do extremely well. How do you experience anosmia? What is your greatest reward from doing these studies? What has been the greatest challenge? What did you think you knew, but caught you by surprise?

*Logistics and how you can help*
We have a pretty big group here and not everyone can or will want to contribute in the same way. We think all kinds of contributions can be helpful. You can mastermind a series of quizzes. Or you can make infographics or other images. Or you can just share consistently in your own network. Or repost GCCR members papers that come up in social media. Or you can just repost content in your own language.  You can start immediately by retweeting and tagging ""@GCChemosensoryR"" on your regular Twitter browsing whenever you encounter anything of interest.  Feel free to immediately make suggestions in this channel too.

*Platforms*
We will focus on Twitter and will also make an effort to expand to Instagram. Twitter is classically really good for science. But we will reach a whole new audience of more general public via instagram. So Instagram will also be interesting to initiate. We can look into creating or linking a Facebook account that just reposts from Twitter and Instagram, which will again reach a different audience, but then without too much extra effort.
For Twitter we will use Tweetdeck with some of us getting access for now. We have yet to figure out at what size that group will be optimal, so stay tuned on that. Send <@U010TS2UJKF> a message if you want to go on the list of people considered for Tweetdeck access to the GCCR account.
For Instagram, <@U0111UP77AB> will be initiating this effort and we have yet to figure out how that can be done as a team effort, but get in touch with her if you want to actively be involved in administering that account.

*Links with other GCCR groups/committees*
If you are part of other groups in GCCR, we encourage you to use that for social media content. You can promote your project. Or for example content that is generated for the (soon to be announced) newsletter (liaison: <@U010TQQ3W6Q> ) can generate content for us and vice versa. Some channels discuss literature in depth, and we can benefit from that.

*Inclusive and global* 
We do global research and we strive to be diverse and inclusive. The GCCR communicates primarily in English (except when recruiting for specific language research materials). Since a lot of networks are also within language, this makes sense. It would be ineffective to tweet in mulitple languages for the same account, and other organizations may solve this by having secondary spin-off accounts for same content in a different language. We are exploring this, because it would greatly benefit our reach in languages that use a lot of social media but not in secondary languages. Thank you <@U011VFZA87P> for bringing up this very important point, stay tuned for more on this.

*Hashtags*
We will do some research on this. #anosmia is being used more often these days. #flavor and #flavour are good.  #smellloss and #cantsmell are important now, as well as of course any covid-related hashtags. When posting from GCCR account using #GCCR is probably a waste of characters.

*Materials*
We already have some channels for social media materials. It would be great if someone can create an inventory of those channels and identify where there is unnecessary overlap, what is missing and whether Slack channels are the appropriate solution. We'll need a list of links and descriptions to those other channels on this channel and pin that message for future reference.

*Study recruitment messages &amp; study result messages* 
Development phase; formulated by project team, variations with input from social media team, approved by leadership team. Message while in development will prefaced with :memo:.
Post approved message from offical GCCR social media account. Approved messages will be prefaced with :loudspeaker::earth_africa:
Members should only retweet the offical GCCR messages from their personal accounts, not copy-paste.

For these we need to have a stricter process, because they may influence recruitment and the publication process.

Then for *other kinds of content*, I would suggest posting to this channel first so we can get a feel for how to handle that. We may figure out a workflow for that later.

In NL, we have an online platform asking questions about (corona) symptoms that anyone can fill out, and sends out weekly reminders to gather followup information. This seems a valuable outlet for our questionnaire (though the platform has been down most of the time, as so many people wanted to fill it out).

Of those 3191 patients surveyed, 488 patients (15.3%) expressed smell or taste loss: smell loss = 386 patients (12.1%); taste loss = 353 patients (11.1%); both = 251 patients (7.9%). Of those 488 smell or taste loss patients, 156 patients were in the 20s, 71 patients in the 30s, and 72 patients in the 40s (the majority were found in the 20s).
1462 patients did not have any flu (fever, sore throat, chest pain) symptoms. Of these 1462 (asymptomatic) patients, 189 patients (12.9%) expressed difficulty in smell; taste loss =143 patients (9.8%); both =119 patients (8.1%).
The vice president of the medical society also described the importance of COVID19 testing and self-isolation for those who have a sudden smell or taste loss even without flu symptoms.”

I think public can have a kick at that to monitor evolution of sense of smell over several days.  They should have more smells from the bedrooms too haha but kitchen bathroom and some living room already fun.  Is totally in complement as it explores timing (simple questions repeat over several days) and to explore variations in odor qualities (liking and strength of very familiar odors of each subject) to the questionnaire of this group.,message,

U010UTDM4HE,covid-19-agenda,2020,03,30,2020-03-30,"My thoughts of today (partially from my e-mail to my network group): there is a very interesting article saying that the reason of lung failure is because of the 
infection in the brain by the virus at the area called medulla oblongata. The article is in The Scientist: 
<https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/lost-smell-and-taste-hint-covid-19-can-target-the-nervous-system-67312>

This was a big eye-opening info at least for me. I thought infection to olfactory sense may cause infection to brain because olfactory system is connected directly to the brain, but I did not think it can be the reason of this high fatality. I was thinking more of a long-term damage in the patients after they recovered. 

Here is from the article: ""medulla oblongata, which is part of the brain stem that serves as the control center for the heart and the lungs, the damage could contribute to “acute respiratory failure of patients with COVID-19.” 
Also: ""the time it takes for COVID-19 to progress from first symptoms to difficulty breathing is typically five days; patients are then admitted to the hospital roughly two days later, and a day after that put into intensive care. “The latency period is enough for the virus to enter and destroy the medullary neurons""

Also: ""In a 2008 study, immunologist Stanley Perlman of the University of Iowa and colleagues showed that SARS-CoV—the virus that caused the SARS outbreak that killed more than 770 people in 2003—entered the brains of transgenic mice expressing human ACE2 through neurons in the nose. The virus then rapidly spread to connecting nerve cells. The extensive nerve damage was the major cause of death, the team reported, even though low levels of the virus were detected in the animals’ lungs."" ""Death of the animal likely results from dysfunction and/or death of infected neurons, especially those located in cardiorespiratory centers in the medulla""
Pneumonia and difficulties in breathing made me think of the lung, but actually it is maybe necessary to focus on neuronal infection and infection in the medulla of the brain...  I know ACE2 is expressed in many places. If failure of lung from infection in the medulla is the cause of deaths, which location in the body that ACE2s are expressed is the most effective entrance for virus to reach medulla could be an important question because we can delay the process and earn time by focusing on protecting this area. If olfactory system is the one, we really need to say that masks are seriously important to suppress fatality.",message,
U010UTDM4HE,covid-19-agenda,2020,03,30,2020-03-30,"I discussed with my colleague and here is a response to my question about the infection to medulla: ""There are several paths from the lungs to the medulla. The most common would be to a dorsal respiratory group that includes the vagus and glossopharangeal nerves. However, there is also a spinal-motor path to a ventral respiratory group that seems to manage ongoing involuntary respiration.
Damage to the ventral group could account for why people need respirators -- the muscles managing involuntary background breathing would just stop working. Damage in the dorsal group could account for respiratory adjustments, taste, and olfaction problems.""  I want to propose that this is a huge suggestion to the whole strategy to the reason of anosmia and dysgeusia. They could be all from the infection reaching to medulla. The infection reaching to the ventral medulla causing the lung failure, killing so many people, and infection to the dorsal medulla causing the anosmia and dysgeusia. I would say, it is not the time to look at the nose. We need to focus on the medulla of the brain.",message,
U010MRTQM3Q,covid-19-agenda,2020,03,30,2020-03-30,"Hi Sachiko - could you expand a little on the assertion that dorsal medulla is involved in smell perception? Is the idea that this reflects anteriorly-projecting activity from the dorsal raphe (which almost certainly is not specific to the olfactory system, and is thought to modulate rather than gate olfactory signaling in the bulb)? I have never heard of activity in medulla being obligate for odor perception, and a quick Pubmed search was not revealing…but would love to learn more!",message,

I did not know about it until I heard from him either and got super excited because it will explain the rapid lung failure and anosmia and dysgeusia. I was wondering, if that is the case, if there are any methods to delay/stop the process of infection toward medulla, which might suppress fatality.",message,
U0114E37V3R,covid-19-agenda,2020,03,30,2020-03-30,"One thing to note with the original papers that show viral infection in the brain in mouse models--it's done using a krt18-driving expression of human Ace2.

U0107KBFZ7V,covid-19-sweden,2020,03,24,2020-03-24,"Hi all! Thanks for this great initiative. W regards to the questions asked, I got the impression (1) ethics will be a US-based attempt which can be used globally for the consortium? (2) Distributing the survey to affected individuals would probably be a broad strategy, where we advertise widely, contact medical staff, post on social media, etc, and then clean dataset before analysis. If we want some clinical validity in the self assessment of COVID-we should add a question about which hospital and when the test was done. Still not immune to false responses, but perhaps this is the most reliable data one can hope for given the challenge of reaching as many affected as possible. On the positive side, many COVID-19 patients with smell or taste loss are likely to either google the symptoms and find the survey, or hear about it from other sources (since the disease is most often not debilitating enough to prevent people from such activities). Just my 2 cents!",message,

If we have the data on why they think they have COVID-19 (like the questions in Mashas survey) it will be easy to screen at a later stage (use suitable inclusion criteria, e.g. someone who reports to have been diagnosed by swab at Karolinska Hospital March 25 would be included). My argument is that there is no reason to have strict inclusion criteria at the data collection phase, unless we have data storage capacity problems.

U010KDF9AVD,covid-19hometest,2020,03,23,2020-03-23,"What John Hayes previously recommended for relevant literature:
I think we can design a robust testing protocol people can do at home -- a key is to have it be longitudinal to see if and when function starts to come back.
 
I have a compusense cloud license that works globally so we should be able to collect intensity rating data and not just yes / no survey questions.
 
In terms of protocol, we could start by adapting the tongue tip / whole mouth assessment from NHANES, since that will give us a baseline reference of ‘normal’.
 
Here is the protocol, with photos and detailed gLMS training procedure:
<https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/nhanes_13_14/Taste_Smell.pdf>
 
Data code books from NHANES, including in home survey questions:

<https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2013-2014/CSX_H.htm>
 
Last, you probably already have it from my twitter posts, but here is the chapter Val Duffy and I just wrote on functional assessment in a clinical contest, including the jelly bean test. I really like the idea of swapping out jelly beans for gummi bears or gum drops if those are more globally available.
 
<https://psu.app.box.com/s/sdax52tjkrxqhtlt3ib1urlz774c3gtt>
 
In the Duffy chapter, please look at the old Connecticut Chemosensory Clinical Research Center Test from the late 1980s and think about how we might adapt it to a global (or at least first world industrial) audience. For example, instead of Ivory soap, is there a globally available unilever product? That is, sniffin sticks and BSIT are obviously better, but to start, we probably want initial data from products people can source locally?",message,

U010KDF9AVD,covid-19hometest,2020,03,25,2020-03-25,"The app is good. Very much like what I would aim for.
Here is what it entails: you select one odor from multiple in categories. Sweet food odor, savory food odor, trigeminal food odor,  (category 4 not sure what it represents, I had ground coffee), care product. You are asked to set each ready and sniff them and then rate pleasantness and intensity on VAS scales. Then at the end you are asked to rate your sense of smell ""today"" on a VAS scale with anchors ""deteriorated"" and improved.
It's fast and easy to do, the interface works well, the categories are well chosen. I think that some of the choices within categories might be pretty ""mediterranean"", but I'm not sure of that.
I also noticed that I could indicate my symptoms, but not that i don't have them anymore.
There was a question about Quarantaine, but I think that is a bit ambiguous, self-isolation, social distancing etc may also be answered as a yes, but there is a lot of variation there?
My main criticism is that it doesnt include taste and retronasal olfaction and that is sometimes the first thing people notice (but granted, it is a *smell* tracker).
I find that the disclaimers and the fact that the data are used for scientific research should be more upfront, They are in the terms of use and you are asked to opt in, but it would be better to have that at least summarized. Is there a possibility to delete or retract data (necessary for GDPR)?
Does just pleasantness capture the parosmia dimension or would it be better to also ask for that more explicitly?",message,

U0107D4SH25,covid-19hometest,2020,03,29,2020-03-29,"I think that it would be nice to have formal, reliable and validated tests out there, but I also think this is not possible, and this is not the idea of this &lt;home test&gt;. simply because these validated are not available world-wide, they are expensive, and even if ordered, it would take a long time before they get (especially given the current situation in international air traffic).

 This is why Chrissie and I have been thinking of using household items that have a smell. As you can see form the leaflet we come up with a short list of things that should be available in many places (you probably experienced that yourself, but it is often surprising to see the various lifestyles of people which are different from mine and my academic bubble).
Chemosnensory test at home with foods/odors:
 We also sofar thought about a very simple *odor identification test* and did not think about odor thresholds. I and people in my lab tried to establish simple thresholds at home, but this is for most people extremely difficult if not impossible, and highly variable, even if people have experience with olfactory testing!
 One other idea is to rate odor intensity and pleasantness over time - the arbitrary quesition is here, how often should that be done. Daily or weekly.

As for *taste testing*: the idea would be to ask people to taste a small amount of real sugar, salt, vinegar, and coffee powder/tea leaves or tea from a tea bag, so that they could see whether they are able to perceive that on a suprathreshold level. testing umami is probably extremely difficult. we tried that in our lab in patients over the last two years, and without help people do not know hat umami is and how it tastes. And then there probably is no clear umami taste without an odor in most households.

 As for *trigeminal testing*: I think people could smell vinegar or mustard or horseradish, but please try it out in your kitchen, the trigeminal sensation is not very strong. Oral trigeminakl testing should be much easier.

 Sorry for the very long mail. So my current idea would be
 - suprathreshold odor identification of 4 household items
 - tracking of the intensity and pleasantness of these items over time
 - suprathreshold taste testing of sweet/sour/salty/bitter
 - suprathrehold testing of trigeminal sensation nasally for one or two items
 - suprathrehold testing of trigeminal sensation orally for one or two items

Please keep in mind that his should be supersimple and extremely doable. It is meant to help people to put their complaints in perspective so that they can judge whether their experienced taste/smell/trigeminal loss is complete or partial, and that they can track this over time at their homes, before they can go out and get an appointment for a real chemosensory test.",message,

 as to the *orthonasal testing*: Kathrin will come up with an extended list of smelly items that should be available in most households. we could then discuss those quickly (Barry, Chrisophe, Orietta and Michele are very interested in taht), add or delete, and then out is to the test.
 Ther was also a discussion whether or not to add/be isired by the list Noam sobel uses in his smelltracker app. Tere was also the thought to abandon the current approach and just apply a link to the smelltracker. The purpose there, however, is very much on tracking, our immediate goal here is (or at least, was) to provide quick, one-stop self-testing

 as to *retronasal testing*: I think that is a very good idea, and it should be possible to suggest material that could be used in standard household for retronasal testing instead of jelly beans (I guess not every US-American household has jelly beans either; julie mentioned that a flavored hard candy would work as well ) with pinched / unpinched noses. Ta least we coud easily try with which materials apart from jelly beans this also works.

 as to the *order to these suggestions*: I think it shoud be in the order of significane of the symptoms mentioned sofar in COVID patients: orthonasal olfactory - gustatory - retroansla olfactory - trigeminal

 as to the *time frame of questoning:* Julie mentioned that this should be asked for several time frames e.g., during past week. Barry suggested to focus people�s minds again on household items. How aware were you of the smell of the soap of shampoo you use, of cooking smells, fresh laundry smells. Often they respond to these Qs.

 Julie also mentioned *collaborations with NIH etc.* (or efforts like *All of Us* [<https://allofus.nih.gov/>] ). I guess that is a good idea to look into this, but I am not certain whether this should be added here as this is about home testing with household items, some very rough screening. Maybe this could added for a later phase?

 Valerie pointed towards *standardized self-report,* such as those in the National Health and Nutrition Examination, which are available here (<https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2011-2012/CSQ_G.htm>).

U0107DF9NQH,covid-19hometest,2020,03,30,2020-03-30,"I sometimes have to evaluate patients by video call.  Patients answer a previous questionnaire where they put their symptoms, history and other data for diagnosis.  At the beginning of the video call, we reviewed the data from the questionnaire, asked the questions better and finally carried out a brief test: 1. the patient, under my instructions, carried out dilutions with water and ethyl alcohol (in Argentina these elements are always there), in wells  small, total: 5 solutions, at one end only water and at the other only alcohol.  The patient smells 2 to 3 times each well, from the one with only water to the one with alcohol alone.  This gives me an idea of whether the patient is in hyposmia or anosmia (would be the quantitative part).

2. the qualitative or identification part of odors: in 5 small wells the patient must put, not more than half of each well, what they have at home: 1-laundry soap 2-chocolate in small pieces  3-coffee 4-dried oregano (can be another spice in the house) and 5-Vick or toothpaste (mint).

3. Finally: trigeminal evaluation with Vick or toothpaste or alcohol alone, from the previous test.

4. The conclusion of the test: I use a scale from 0 to 5: where 5-4 is normosmia;  3-2 is hyposmia and 1-0 is anosmia.

To evaluate the retronasal: with the chocolate and clamping the nostrils and then without clamping: in patients with normosmia and hyposmia, they first say they feel just sweet and then with good nasal ventilation: they identify the chocolate.  The anosmics respond the same, in both situations.

To complete the taste evaluation: I tell you to dilute a teaspoon of salt in a small well with water;  the same with sugar;  another well with lemon juice and another with bitter herbal tea.  In that order, I tell you to suck a little from each well, and try to feel the salty, sweet, etc.  Between each well, the mouth should be rinsed with plain water.  This allows me to explain to the patient, that in a high percentage, the absent is the smell and not the taste, it may be diminished but not absent.  Explained the difference between taste and flavor.

I hope I have been able to help with this contribution of my clinical experience caring for patients with alterations of smell and taste, since 1998, in Argentina.

We need more information on whether smell loss should be recognised as a marker for Covid-19. Cane we spend our energies dealing with that now? Information is patchy out there, others are proposing surveys without the huge power and experience of the scientists and medics in GCCR and we need to get something out there soon, in order to capture more evidence and be better able to advise. Besides, as <@U010TT59WQP> points out we need to delegate work to smaller group who can draw things together and make sure they get things done in the necessary timescale. This worked well with the coordinating team and the <#C010KLR163G|covid-19questionnaire> channel. The former presented drafts and we all responded with lots of comments and suggestions. The coordinating team then had the invidious task of taking detailed feedback from (less than 81?) respondents and drawing everything together for the next iteration. Extremely grateful to them for working so hard and so cooperatively to do this over the weekend. Think we are getting closer and closer. I hope so. If we can keep focus, we'll get there with the questionnaire and can move the the home testing. We owe it to all those who have experienced sudden smell loss to find out what we can and feed back what we can. Very grateful to the core committee, to <@U010GME5DU4> <@U010616MZ99> <@U0107D4SH25> <@U010HHC57T2> <@U010MSNP3FH> <@U010H1EC3J8> who are doing a spectacular job on what feels like a Moon Shot project.

As you know, it is difficult to find trigeminal stimuli that are both strong and without an equally strong odor in a household. Also, intranasal trigeminal sensations are often confused with odor sensations so you will not be sure what they report on since the odor associated with the trigeminal stimuli will more or less inherently be stronger than the odors from the non-trigeminal stimuli. It is therefore hard to know if the trigeminal sensation reported is trigeminal or odor. Also, as many already already put forward, it is very unlikely to be affected by the C19 virus so you are just adding testing with very little information to be had from it. I recommend that you remove it from the testing package.",message,

I do it in my clinical practice: with the undiluted ethyl alcohol or vinegar that is always in the homes.  Anosmic patients report that with these stimuli they feel burning or freshness, even with less intensity, and they say that they do not smell, only trigeminal activity.  That helps me to make the diagnosis of anosmia.  Those who present hyposmia, say they feel the smell of alcohol or vinegar and reject the stimulus because it bothers them, something that is not seen in the anosmic, they feel the irritation but not the smell and they do not reject it: the intensity feels low.

I also want to contribute that teaching the patient the difference between taste and flavor is important, since they are very distressed thinking that they lost 2 senses and not 1, smell, in a large percentage of patients.  In an investigation like this, my opinion may not be very useful, but I want to tell you that you have to question people in the simplest way: there are many people, including doctors, who do not know about smell and taste, the basic foundations, how to know  the difference between taste and flavor and that is trigeminal activity.

Identifying universally familiar and readily available odors will be difficult, and you'd really need to have a pre-packaged test so patients don't know beforehand what the odor set is. You'd also need to identify and provide universally appropriate response alternatives, since we know folks have trouble labeling odors without some verbal or written cue.",message,

The spontaneous reports I've seen on social media all declare a surprise that everyday things lack any smell: coffee, toothpaste, soap, hand sanitzer (these days). That's why identification may be asking more than we need and creating a logistical and design challenge. Wouldn't it tell us something about change they are aware of if familiar things - grass, laundry, coffee/tea etc -  didn't smell as they did before, or didn't smell of anything? I know it would be much better to have more precise tests and measures but the more the test requires in set up the less we might get by way of returns. Our suspicion/hypothesis is that there are far more people out there likely to have symptoms of Covid 19 or be asymptomatic carriers of it who say they cannot taste and smell anything, and these are unlike cases of blocked nose with a cold. Finding out if familiar items smell as they usual do/smell of anything, and that what they think as loss of taste does not affect gustation, would give us pretty useful evidence for loss of smell being highly correlated with Covid 19 - which is what the recently published Iranian study shows.

Smell: the patient must be unscented, without smoking and without using perfumed cosmetics or hand creams;  the environment must be free of odors (eg food, air fresheners, cigarette smoke if you smoke).  2. Taste: do not eat mints or spicy or other very strong substances.  For both: do not smoke 1-2 hours before the tests, or the time that you consider necessary.

As far as I am concerned, if they pick 5 (preferably 10) odors that they know (normally) have a smell and they cannot smell a single one of them, I would classify them as being anosmic even though they all might be mostly emitting aldehydes or alcohols etc. I think that it is more important to give them a list of what not to pick and then list common items with a clear trigeminal sensation with them.

The specific discussion of what odors to pick IS important from a normal clinical point of view where you will see patients with a range of potential causes, some of which cause specific anosmia and some general. In this case, we will diagnose them not on the smell test but on listing of all their other symptoms (or C19 testing being done). In other words, you are not wrong discussing this. I just am not convinced that we need to delay the test further due to this. I am being concerned that we are missing the the large increase in C19 cases in most areas of the world that is now starting to be hit. Speed is at the essence here. But, as I said, this is my opinion and I am not claiming that this is a fact. The leadership needs to decide at this point what they want and make a decision.",message,

Adding umami to the list seems to me not necessary, in this study.  What you propose is in patients with chemotherapy, I understand what you explain, but it is not the same, the cause is not the same, and I think that in the COVID-19, following the experience of the usual viral post viral, the absent is  smell and to a lesser extent taste.  In my personal experience, in post viral, the taste is not totally lost and the flavor is, which indicates the olfactory component.  After a few months, patients report regaining taste and eating normally.  I had very few cases where in post-viral the patients do not manage to eat well.

In addition, I told of my clinical experience as an ENT with 22 years of experience in evaluating and treating patients with alterations of smell and taste, where the absent is almost always smell.  Explaining to the patient what is happening to him with a post viral condition, after a follow-up of up to 5-6 years, the patient who did not recover, reports a lack of smell and not taste, of course it will not be the same as before, his  Delight at food or drink is not as subtle as before, but they get over this and eat in such a way that they continue to live and have good nutrition.

If we can have finalized translations of the final questionnaire, we can (hopefully?) have those live at initial launch. We will then add other translations as we go.

The two major sticking points Alyssa and I see _currently_ are a) the GDPR requirements about being able to be removed, and b) the question of _truly_ anonymous data versus confidential identifiers held on a secure platform, and only sharing fully deidentified data publicly.

I really want to have email addresses so we can recontact people for followup in later studies, either in a home use test, or maybe in person lab testing down the road, but collecting and retaining email addresses will slow down IRB approval slightly.

Instead, we are writing a single site IRB protocol out of my lab in the US that should be compliant with both California privacy rules and GDPR regulations. We are using Compusense, a Canadian data collection platform that is well versed in both CA and GDPR rules (and their servers are located in Canada as well).

The really good news is that our current path forward (exempt versus expedited protocol) means that _we do not need to have the individual translated surveys approved individually_.  On the landing page for the survey, participants will be given an option to select their local language. (This is very routine with global consumer goods companies).

*I may reach out if if we need help translating consent language for localized pages.*

Whether you chose to share the link to our multilingual version of core survey once it goes live is ultimately up to individual investigators. <@U010GME5DU4> or <@U010KDF9AVD> can correct me, but my understanding is that in the spirit of open science researchers will always have the option of taking the core GCCR questionnaire and getting their own ethics approval for local use, but of course, that takes lots of time and time is short.",message,

I have three questions that i hope that someone might be able to answer.
1. Are we initially only applying for the online questionniare and not home testing? What is the status on the home test?
2. Do we need to have access to a compusense license or will you enter the Swedish version on your license?
3. As soon as we are satisfied with the Swedish translation, should we hand in the IRB application or will there be revision for a few rounds first?

2. Your translation will be sent to <@U010MSNP3FH> who is going to include it in the global Compusense link. Data sharing procedures in process. Stay tuned for that too.

We already have approval for something similar but just to be safe that we can share the data, I will ad it to this application and hope that I am wording it enough generically. We need to pay for each application so I rather push all in at once.
Since we are allowed to change wordings and minor things in questionniares without reapplying for IRB, I will then push the application in today as soon as we have a satisfactory translation done here in Sweden. If there are changes, and they are not major, we can always ad that (only changes that will change risk assessment needs new amendment and that is highly unlikely).",message,

U01062RS9R9,covid-19questionnaire,2020,03,23,2020-03-23,"Hi all,
 
Thanks for posting the link again Masha! And thanks again for putting it together.
 
The comment that Sanne is referring to is re the smell question (‘please rate your sense of smell before or during being sick’) - at the moment I think ‘before or during’ will confuse participants as to whether they put their pre-morbid olfactory function or morbid/current state. In order to get the ball rolling for UK ethics, I had put the paper version that Thomas and I made into an online form - have a look at the smell question on here (with differentiation between before, during and after illness). I know it makes the questionnaire longer, but I think its clearer? Pre-filled link:  <https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfUgTgIP1Sy_GNr3B_x-FRKtiWJWFuA4VAexrEcMsi5ihmrXA/viewform?usp=pp_url&amp;entry.1806339579=Test&amp;entry.355740587=99&amp;entry.1675286659=Female&amp;entry.847695596=NONE&amp;entry.1715906036=Symptoms+only&amp;entry.504878878=2020-03-23&amp;entry.1128209756=Yes+-+partly&amp;entry.271525452=Fever&amp;entry.271525452=Cough&amp;entry.2102529823=none&amp;entry.2024222028=10&amp;entry.2113406070=2&amp;entry.967198324=2&amp;entry.1113284690=10&amp;entry.93574667=5&amp;entry.1511114378=5&amp;entry.615005420=Yes+-+it+comes+and+goes&amp;entry.228988573=Smell+less+strong+than+they+did+before&amp;entry.228988573=Smell+different+compared+to+before+being+ill+(i.e.+the+quality++of+smell+has+changed)&amp;entry.1610825876=10&amp;entry.1068660442=5&amp;entry.521148402=2&amp;entry.46971710=Sweet&amp;entry.46971710=Salty>
 
Other small points - I added a question on co-morbidities, and converted the 'nasal breathing' question into a similar scale as the smell question, but wrote 'blocked nose' instead of nasal breathing (conceivably if a patient is having difficulty breathing due to lower respiratory tract symptoms, this can confound this question - so better to ask about 'blocked nose'). There are also two short questions on qualitative function and fluctuation in function. Maybe there should also be a question on smoking??
 
Once we have all agreed on the questions - and have a final version – I guess the nominated ‘lead’ for each country/region should have their email embedded within the questionnaire. Access to and management of data we can then discuss – perhaps regional access for all local team members (if on googleforms everyone can be added as a collaborator). But guess this depends on local GDPR/ethics.
 
See you all tomorrow on zoom.

I agree that it is crucial to not have any ""A or B"" questions but to be very precise and leave no room for interpretation to the patients. What I am missing in the questionnaire is the trigeminal/mouthfeel part. I mean, we don't know whether it is affected, but we could test this easily. Did you see my related edits to Thomas' questionnaire? Also, since this is going to be online and does not need to fit on one page anymore, I think we could ask about some practical food experiences, e.g. Does your coffee / favorite food ""tastes"" different than before your illness?",message,

• question ""What symptoms do/did you have?"" it's a double-barreled question. Can we have two ""do you have"" and ""did you have"". In the latter case, when? I was not sure how to respond. Also, add None as a response option. 
• Perhaps the none answer can be used as an exit answer or do we also want to monitor people that are truly asymptomatic and *retest* them. In this respect, an easy way is to include at the end the question, ""is this the first time you complete this questionnaire?"" yes/no. If not, this  is the nth time that I complete the questionnaire. (not perfect, but it can give us *longitudinal data*).

U01062RS9R9,covid-19questionnaire,2020,03,26,2020-03-26,"My reply I posted on the agenda thread: Hi Pablo - I've shared your comment on the questionnaire thread - if we are trying to use the same questions internationally - regarding the topic of the question, e.g. 'coffee' - how specific would this have to be (e.g. coffee rather than breakfast)? I ask thinking about how we  find a culturally universal smell/taste",message,
U010RH2PEMB,covid-19questionnaire,2020,03,26,2020-03-26,In the questionnaire I propose to change the qustion: Do you have any of the following medical conditions? to: Do or did you have any of the following medical conditions? since e.g. people who had cancer one yeras ago and are without symptoms now would likely answer no if only asked if they do have cancer,message,

U010LKHD4RK,covid-19questionnaire,2020,03,26,2020-03-26,I guess this is looking for metallic taste but 'bad or other' might capture persistent sweet taste that some report (often with lung tumours),message,

1 or 2 universal smells would ground the study with reference points, no pun intended, and easier for people to think concretely on concrete items where they might suddenly realized “oh yes actually now that you are saying it, i haven’t smelt that  last time”  people don’t notice presence or absence of smells many times until you pinpoint. Coffee, pizza, coca cola, toasts, Ojuice, toothpaste, chewing gums, could be common ones.  How many would be a good number? 2 or 3?",message,

Thus you have a choice: a) just give out the URL to our core global survey and live without mods, or b) ADD your own mods to the core version and get your own local ethics approval. (Also, you cannot mod the core version, as that causes data integration and data analysis issues).

Thank you to all who participated in today’s call: it is exciting to see this collaboration growing.

*Summary of today's meeting:* 
• Review of vision, mission, authorship and data sharing policies of GCCR.
• The questionnaire team is updating the questions based on the comments provided during the call. They will send us a new version of the questionnaire to comment on shortly (it will be posted on a dedicated channel, and available for review for ~24h). *To speed up the review process, please read all the comments previously posted and use the emoticons to express your preferences. Only post a new comment if the topic you want to raise is new.*  Keep in mind that the questionnaire has to be:
o  short (&lt;5 min)
o  tailored to the general population (not only COVID-19 patients)
o  worded in a way that considers the state of emergency in which some of the respondents may be experiencing

• Make sure to read and complete in a timely fashion (no later than March 25th 3pm EST) the agreement form that you find here: <https://forms.gle/1tgC7K7kytZQPjTw6> this will allow me to create country group channels
•  Each country group should elect a leader that will be in closer contact with the leadership team
• The next meeting (date to be determined) will be focused on the development of the self-assessment tool. Please, include your observations in the channel <#C010KLR8YRL|covid-19hometest> so that I can create an agenda.
• Considering the time zone restrictions, the meetings may be generally held on Tuesdays at 1pm (like today). If this is highly inconvenient to you, please contact me (<mailto:valentina.parma@temple.edu|valentina.parma@temple.edu>) to evaluate alternatives.
• The Slack global channel now counts 131 subscribers and counting!
• We are also now on twitter, with the handle <https://twitter.com/GCChemosensoryR|@GCChemosensoryR> and the hashtag #GCCR. Please use them and spread the info widely. Thank you to those who have already done so.

-      Please if you have not done so already, please *sign the agreement* here: <https://forms.gle/1tgC7K7kytZQPjTw6> it is paramount to determine the countries represented in the consortium.

-      All those who have signed the agreement are included in their respective country channels.

-      The first draft of the questionnaire is submitted to the #test_questionnaire_draf1 and has been reviewed. The questionnaire team will revise and post tomorrow the last version to be submitted to the IRB.

-      Update on IRB. Latest reports support the idea of having the global IRB approved for the core questionnaire by the end of Friday. By tomorrow night ET (March 26th) the translations of the single countries should be ready for inclusion in the platform Compusense.

-      To move forward the next steps (e.g., self-assessment) we are considering to hold a meeting this Friday, March 27th at 1pm ET. This will be confirmed tomorrow.


Meanwhile…
* *
-      *Select a country leader* and communicate it to me ASAP <@U010GME5DU4> or <mailto:valentina.parma@temple.edu|valentina.parma@temple.edu> (I only have 2 at the moment)

-      The country leader should include themselves in the *<#C010G3PTSQZ|country_leaders> channel*

-      *Translate the questionnaire by country*. Include the translation team in one thread to keep track of contribution. Some countries may share languages with other groups (e.g., Switzerland). Please, touch base with the groups that are working on translations in the same language so that we have one translation per language. ***This has to be finalized on the latest version of the questionnaire which will be released tomorrow before lunch ET time. ***
* *
-      *Back-translation* allows us to compare translations with the original content for accuracy and quality. To achieve that select one person per country (proficient in English) who does not participate in the first round of the translation, but acts as a back translator. The back translation does not have to be identical to the original English version of the questionnaire, but differences will help to identify any errors, ambiguities or confusion that may arise from the nuances of language. The country group will vote on the version to present.

-      Once the back translation is complete, please communicate it to me and *include your translation in the <#C010U1Q49FG|core_questionnaire_back> channel* no later than *Thursday March 26th 6pm ET time.*",message,
U010GME5DU4,dailysummary-see-key_announcements,2020,03,26,2020-03-26,"*March 26th*

-      As of tonight ET, we are 282 Slack subscribers and 92 members (agreement signed). Please if you have not done so already, please *sign the agreement* here: <https://forms.gle/1tgC7K7kytZQPjTw6>. As of now, the countries represented are 24.  

-      We contacted the ISOT 2020 organizing team to reach out to all chemosensory societies worldwide to highlight the GCCR and gather other members.

-      Please, spread the word particularly across c*ountries and groups that are currently underrepresented*, to allow for true global outreach. To spread the information you can use this document.  

-      The final version of the questionnaire has been released. *March 27th 12pm ET is the deadline for the translations*. Country leaders please help maintain this time schedule or communicate with me if unable to. After that all available translations (submission as a word document please) will be provided to <@U010MSNP3FH> for implementation in Compusense.

-      The *country leader* should report who worked on the translation of the questionnaire and who was the back translator for their version.

-      Translation: in the *<#C010J3PGH7D|translation_offered>* you can offer your services as back translator (if you have not participated in the translation from the English version provided) or you can *offer to translate the questionnaire in a non-represented language*.

-      As soon as the questionnaire is deployed we are planning on communicating the presence of the group widely. The members in the *#outreach* channel will provide initial help. Please reach out if you have other options.

-      No meeting will be held tomorrow (Friday March 27th). Stay tuned for the beginning of next week with a series of decisions to make.

Dear All,

As of now, the IRB has not yet been approved, but this is expected to happen early next week. IRB may still require small changes before deployment. <@U010MSNP3FH>, <@U010QF09GB0> and colleagues at Penn State have been working hard to make this pantagruelic project happen.

Alongside them, the questionnaire team has been working thoroughly and as fast as possible to include the comments raised in this final version, fill in some obvious blind spots and adapt it to the platform Compusense, which presented wording and response set constraints. Thank you <@U010HHC57T2>, <@U010KM0A4KG>, <@U0107D4SH25> and <@U010MSNP3FH> for your efforts.

*The goals of the CORE QUESTIONNAIRE are:* 
• To assess the prevalence &amp; representation of taste/smell problems in COVID-19+/flu- vs. COVID-19-/flu+/healthy participants
• To evaluate longitudinally the changes in taste/smell problems in the three groups
:bangbang:Please check out the link to English survey::bangbang:
<https://psusensory.compusensecloud.com/edu/login.aspx?t=9bb1c254-df61-4338-a1d3-3e5f43082669>


*ACTION – TEST CORE QUESTIONNAIRE &amp; COMMENT*: We ask volunteers to take the core questionnaire and provide comments in the following google doc form for feedback *by March 29th at 12PM ET*:
 
<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RXlHM7o3fHk-zq1UsLQtlhz0_q1SDYLgsJwlpWGmIls/edit?usp=sharing>

After that, the questionnaire and leadership teams will consider the comments, make the amendments and finalize the version and report back ASAP (likely by Monday morning ET).

This internal testing phase will generate sample data on which scripts for analysis can be created. Team data analysis, please stay tuned.

*ACTION - TRANSLATION*:
The work done so far on the translation will be mostly used. To be aligned with the best practices, the translations should be finalized following these steps (adapted from the Psychological Science Accelerator):
1.    *Original* (English) document is translated from source to target language by A Translator/s resulting in document Version A.
2.    *Back-translation*: Version A is translated back from target to English language by B Translator/s independently resulting in Version B.
3.    *Discussion*: Version A and B are discussed among all translators, discrepancies in Version A and B are detected and solutions are discussed. Version C is created and voted by majority.
4.    *Report*: Country leaders report the names of all A and B translator/s, as well as the results of the vote on Version C (number of favorable votes/all translators). At least two A and two B translators are strongly suggested.
The final translation following the above-mentioned procedures should be done *by* *Monday 5PM ET*.

To maintain the purpose and all the advantages of a consortium (a large cross-cultural dataset), the CORE QUESTIONNAIRE MUST BE COLLECTED THROUGH THE FINAL LINK THAT WILL BE PROVIDED early next week. To ensure consistency of data collection and integrity, each local group IS PROHIBITED from changing the format, the wording or other attributes of the CORE QUESTIONNAIRE.

To discuss the next steps, a *town hall Zoom meeting* will be held on T*uesday March 31st 1pm ET*: <https://temple.zoom.us/j/943110704>
The agenda includes as of now:
-       self-assessment tool
-       group organization
-       milestones

It is incredible to see the enthusiasm, collaboration, dedication and the steps that a group of more than 350 people with different expertise and from different walks of life can achieve together in just a few days to advance the field of chemical senses in the face of COVID-19.

We all feel the urgency to move fast, and we are doing that to the best of our abilities, without compromising scientific rigor and striving to achieve transparent decisions. This will set us up for the long run. Now that the setup of the shared systems and procedures has been established, we will focus on improving them.

I look forward to meeting you virtually on Tuesday.

Best,
Valentina",message,

*To ensure that all the data that the GCCR collects will be publishable, we need to wait for global IRB approval.* The protocol has been submitted and edits have been requested and resubmitted promptly. To avoid continuous changes across versions of the core questionnaire, we will share the core questionnaire in its final approved form to be translated. 

In the meantime you can prepare for the following steps: 

• *Finalize the translation of the core questionnaire*
Each translation then needs to be included in the Compusense platform, and then checked for accuracy by a native speaker. 

To ease the identification of the changes from the previous version of the questionnaire, we have created a _txt file in which you MUST include your translation_. This will speed up the transfer to the Compusense platform. Stay tuned for its release with the final version of the core questionnaire. 


• *List of languages to be deployed in the first batch*
The implementation of translation in the Compusense platform will be done by the Penn State team, in batches. Based on considerations regarding:  
&gt; a) the population size of speakers per language, 
&gt; b) the ability to reach the six continents represented in the GCCR, 
&gt; c) the number of reported cases of COVID-19, 
&gt; d) the presence of a country/language leader (organize the translation and translate the answers to the open questions back to English), 
&gt; e) the reporting on the translation/back translation procedures, 
&gt; f) the default languages available in Compusense
&gt; g) the possibility to share the GCCR core questionnaire link without the need for additional IRB 
the leadership team selected six languages to go live in the first batch. Additional languages will be added according to the criteria above, as resources and interest allow. 

The initial languages are:
English (North America, parts of EU, New Zealand/Australia, Africa)
Spanish (Spain, part of Central and South America)
French (France, Canada, Africa, Switzerland, Belgium)
Italian
German (Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Belgium)
Turkish

Languages, including Hindi, Persian, Arabic and more are planned next.

We ask that _country/language leaders_ clearly communicate the status of the translation in your language by filling in the data and emails in the <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14FNRZswDpUij6Wo8ZrXUWsPV87tB5cBM/edit#gid=1502714484|translations.xlsx> file so that the leadership team can communicate with the country/language teams efficiently. *This information will inform the order in which the other languages will be included in the subsequent waves.* As soon as a decision is made, we will post the list of languages to be added. If you do not have a country/language channel yet contact <@U010KDF9AVD> or <@U010GME5DU4>.


• *I want to prove that I am a member of the GCCR*
If you have signed the agreement form, you can request a member of the leadership to sign a letter for the IRB or for a funding agency confirming that you are a member of the GCCR. You can find a sample of those letters in attachment. 


• *Press releases*
Please include all press releases that mention the GCCR in the <#C011D1CDB7Y|press_releases> channel. Once the questionnaire is live, we will provide a press release template that we encourage to use to disseminate locally. This is the time to alert your press offices. 

Please note that to protect the GCCR’s interest the members speaking with the press should highlight that *no institution/lab/organization is directly part of the GCCR, only the members affiliated to those entities are.* The GCCR is not promoting any institution/lab/organization.


• *GCCR publications*
Please include it in the #relevant_pubs_by gccr members channel all papers that are based on GCCR resources (e.g., protocols, data, ...). They will be posted on the website and social media channels.

Stay tuned for the next information and thank you for your patience.",message,

Please read carefully yesterday's daily summary and check out these highlights:

• *Finalize the translation of the core questionnaire*
Each translation then needs to be included in the Compusense platform, and then checked for accuracy by a native speaker. 

To ease the identification of the changes from the previous version of the questionnaire, we have created a  _the GCCR_translation_template.rtf or .docx in which you MUST include your translation_. You also must complete the _GCCR_translation_responses.xlx file with translation in your language_.
This will speed up the transfer to the Compusense platform.

:exclamation:*Important note:* :exclamation:*you MUST use the GCCR_translation_template.rtf or .docx and the GCCR_translation_responses.xls to submit your translation. You MUST maintain the format of the text as is (bold, underlined).* Once you are done, send both files to <@U010KM0A4KG> for collection.


• *How to share the core questionnaire*
The core questionnaire *MUST* be shared via the options provided.

*DISSEMINATE WIDELY AS OF NOW!*
:bangbang::bangbang::bangbang::bangbang::bangbang::bangbang::bangbang::bangbang::bangbang::bangbang::bangbang::bangbang:

The webpage page will host the core questionnaire in all of the available languages. When a new language becomes available, it will appear on that page.



:exclamation:*Important note:* :exclamation:If you take items from the core questionnaire you must properly acknowledge the GCCR.

:exclamation:*Important note:* :exclamation:Data gathered via other means will not be merged into the core questionnaire databases.

:exclamation:*Important note:* :exclamation:Under the current IRB, you are allowed to disseminate the core questionnaire with the given link globally. If your institution requires local IRB approval, to provide the link in your institutional capacity you must have approval.


• *Press release*
Once you language is about to go live, please consider sharing with your local press office the press release template in GCCR_local_press_release.docx

• *I want to apply for IRB for a local extension of the core questionnaire*
You may! You can submit a separate IRB to ask additional questions/explore additional behaviors. You may NOT report the local part of the GCCR core questionnaire ONLY, but you may report the local GCCR core questionnaire data+other data. *The data from the GCCR core questionnaire will be submitted for publication in global form.* 

As reported in the approved IRB attached here, the core questionnaire data will be de-identified. Yet, participants have the option at the end of the survey to leave their emails to be recontacted. The emails will be paired with an ID code, which will be the ID shared in the database available to all members. Local groups may have access to the emails of participants provided that they present to <@U010MSNP3FH>, the PI of the global IRB, their approved IRB. Each local group is responsible of how the matching between the core questionnaire and their local data may occur.

*One response has been tweaked* *- please reflect it in your translation docs*
• _See GCCR-SmellTasteSurvery-IRBapproved-English-REV7Apr2020.pdf, page 10 highlighted by a red oval : ""I cannot smell at all / Smells smell less strong than they did before”_. 
• We are aware that it is a doubled barreled question (and this is not ideal), but it has been changed to reflect what some patients have been reporting (""I cannot smell anything"").  Anosmia vs hyposmia can be disambiguated by the VAS presented later.
• Why did we go this way rather than just adding a separate answer for anosmia? Because taking down the survey would have caused the data already collected to be lost. 
• Only translations reflecting this edit will be included in Compusense.

• Unified line is good if the text is good.  text needs to be encouraging for public for other platforms.  Could someone who suggested to help in marketing/media think of a more dramatic and sexy instagram/facebook/CNN line really to encourage the public? no more than 2 sentences or 2 lines beside this tweetline: “URGENT:  Fill out this survey to help doctors save lives globally against the virus... and for paying attention to your sense of smell.  Taste impacted as well.” basically some lines that scientists don’t like, but that will make more people fill out the long survey.

So for clarity, there's the buttons on the webpage (gcc..org) and the buttons on the survey platform (compusense).

The buttons on the webpage are simply pointers to the links I was given for the survey platform. These buttons can be configured to say anything, and lead to anywhere.

The links ARE different for the two survey's, so I don't think John is incorrect in saying that it important to have SEPARATE links for each survey. The second set of buttons on the survey platform only appear for the german link. They don't appear for the english one.

Whether or not this could all be put into one pointer to compusense and have people choose the language there is beyond me since I don't know compusense's configuration.

In short, I think the best way forward is to communicate with the german survey team (or whoever made the german survey), and have them look into why there are two buttons. Just a guess, but maybe it is because there are both english and german speaker's in the country? Or maybe it was just an error.

U010BNZ14KT,dailysummary-see-key_announcements,2020,04,09,2020-04-09,"This has come up a few times so edited to display my true intentions. I generally agree with maintaining scientific rigor on our call to action.

_But on a side-note_
Does it overstate? Not to get too philosophical, but help comes in many forms, particularly necessitated by a complex system such as this. Sure, many of us are not on the front lines like my doctor and nursing friends ( and from the stories I've heard, what they're doing is remarkable) But us evidence collecting curious folk are helping also. If not, then why are we here?  Does doing basic science and being one or two steps removed mean what we're doing has less merit to being considered helpful?

And could this help not have the potential to save lives? Sure, this is a survey. Sure, a survey about a lack of smell no less. Sure, we could find a null result and this endeavor fruitless (though I'd wager unlikely given existing literature). But of those doctor and nursing colleagues of mine, more and more are mentioning neurological observations, echoing the literature. Other virus, particularly SARS-CoV-1,  are neurotropic, can cause death via brain dysfunction, and gain entry through the olfactory bulb. I'd posit our survey has the _potential_ to shed light on whether COVID-19 mirrors this, and thus has the _potential_ to increase attention into alternative causes of respiratory or heart failure other than severe pneumonia.

If so, then I would put forward that our study, _albeit a few steps removed,_ has the _potential_ to help save lives.

But I really would like to know if and where I'm missing something, so please share your thoughts on where my logic is misguided.

I would say that the knowledge we gain from this can help reduce spread of the illness, because what is considered asymptomatic does have symptoms (anosmia) but that is not recognized yet. Indirectly it might save lives, but the primarily deliverable might be that anosmia will become a symptom :grin: So I would look in the directions of that for something more tangible to promote.",message,

We are all with good willing and faith but pondering the words is essentials.

4. Multiple domains isn't unprecedented, companies used multiple domains all the time for campaigns and various other use cases. We should however have a discussion about how to use both, when to use one or the other, and a plan to make sure the original doesn't fall out of memory :smile:

I have a comment on the document ""Pre-registration-GCCR001"". I think the hypothesis may need to be reworded because it is too dificult (if not imposible) to powered a study to show ""no effects"" between groups . Even under this circumstance, in which it is understandable that there is no power analys due to the novelty of the disease; it looks like a criticizable  hypothesis.  Do we have enough sample to maybe include some group were we expect to see a difference? for example age-group (more prevalent in younger than older group?

This was an intentional and specific design choice we made to a) avoid issues with memory/recall/reconstruction bias, and b) reduce cognitive load in answering specific questions (without a common frame of 'recent', the wording of individual questions became very complex and overly nuanced).

I totally understand that many of us are uncomfortable with 'losing' data that we could potentially be collecting. That said, even with the strict cutoff (for the reasons above), we still got _thousands_ of completed surveys in the first week after we launched. In hindsight, this suggests our choice to err on the side of the more rigorous entrance criteria was the right one, as it will provide higher quality data and still have sufficient power.

Abstract
We investigated SARS-CoV-2 potential tropism by surveying expression of viral entry-associated genes in single-cell RNA-sequencing data from multiple tissues from healthy human donors. We co-detected these transcripts in specific respiratory, corneal and intestinal epithelial cells, potentially explaining the high efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. These genes are co-expressed in nasal epithelial cells with genes involved in innate immunity, highlighting the cells’ potential role in initial viral infection, spread and clearance. The study offers a useful resource for further lines of inquiry with valuable clinical samples from COVID-19 patients and we provide our data in a comprehensive, open and user-friendly fashion at <http://www.covid19cellatlas.org|www.covid19cellatlas.org>.",message,

Based on some discussions I've had before, I think when you're using a more data driven approach it probably isn't completely necessary. I know OSF requires a good breadth of 'preregistering' (which is beneficial in many ways), but something quicker could be to use <http://aspredicted.org|aspredicted.org>. I think OSF is much better overall, but aspredicted might be better for this project in particular (i.e. and better than not preregistering at all).

U010XM0J9Q8,eds002,2020,05,27,2020-05-27,"Hey everybody, let's try to nail out the overall goal and hypotheses in here before putting it on paper.

The conversation was moving toward the following, but not sure if everybody agreed. It's mostly qualitative analysis.
• Overall goal: Analyze the qualitative aspects of chemosensory loss in the nasal cavity.
• H1. For smell, how are those with qualitative issues different than those with quantitative loss?
• H2. For chemesthesis, how are those with qualitative issues different than those with quantitative loss?
• H3. Are chemesthesis and smell qualitative disorders one in the same?
Valentina also mentioned the possibility of incorporating longitudinal data to measure changes after recovery.

Below is quick text analysis on ~350 of those responses (translation done with google translate). There are another ~450 responses which did not specify a language (only country).

As you can see, ""symptoms"",  ""diagnosed"" and ""tested"" are the most common words.

 I’m trying to answer the questions that have been raised and I am happy to keep the conversation going.

First, rather than changing the entry point to the survey, we may want to push the home test for text analysis. In this tool, everybody (those who had COVID since when it started, has currently COVID, or is healthy can complete the test). I would not change the survey at this point.

 With the current survey data, can we use a dimensional approach on the likelihood on having COVID. The response would be Do you have COVID?: options 2 and 3 (lab test), option 1 (clinical test), option 4 (unknown, but based on the smell ratings they look like they are more COVID than not) and option 5 (covid- lab test).

 We have other text in the emails we receive at the GCCR contact email. There is text mostly from COVID people, if you need to pilot or add.

Would this number of responses that if I gather correctly it’s approximately ~360 people. How comparable are the questions from Julie’s database and the GCCR survey? Could we use that as training set and predict what we will find in the GCCR?

In terms of action points, what can I do to help?",message,
U010XM0J9Q8,eds002,2020,06,27,2020-06-27,"<@U010GME5DU4> <@U010MSNP3FH> It was brought up by <@U010URAFFST> that the question ""Within the past two weeks, have you been diagnosed with or suspect that you have respiratory illness?"" kicks you out of the survey if you say ""no"".  This could be leading to our low number of covid- controls needed for prediction. Can we turn this feature off and just handle ""Nos"" in the analysis?",message,

*Making human chemosensory research more reproducible: learning from the renaissance in psychology*
Speaker: Tristram Wyatt 
*Abstract:*  Research on the human sense of smell often explores subtle effects but with small-scale experiments: across the rest of psychology, typically only 50-70 % of small-scale experiments can be replicated. Human chemosensory research would benefit from adopting the proposals made by psychologists to enable better, more reliable science, with an emphasis on enhancing reproducibility. Key tools are study pre-registration and/or Registered Reports which will also reduce publication bias. These approaches are being used by the new Global Consortium for Chemosensory Research (GCCR). To illustrate the problems and some solutions, I will use the story of the “putative human pheromones” androstadienone and estratetraenol which, despite never having been shown to be pheromones, have been the subject of some 60 studies claiming ‘significant’ positive results.

The goal of the GCCR is to foster the advancement of chemosensory science at large, allowing the possibility to test larger samples of participants cross-culturally, strengthening the reliability and validity of chemosensory science across many domains.
In line with these principles, we welcome the submission of project proposals. Each submission must be presented using the “GCCR Internal Study Proposal Form”. Submissions presented in other formats will not be considered.

Proposed projects can use existing data (from previous or ongoing GCCR projects) or can involve new studies that include data collection by the GCCR. The advantage of doing this work as part of the GCCR is that the consortium infrastructure can be used, improving many aspects of the research process, including reproducibility. This process also means that a project team has to be open to contributions from other members beyond the project team once the proposal is selected.

For more details on this process and how to prepare a project proposal, refer to *<https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EDszuHbeJam2oeBHev4EnDwDzQnYOXA-/view?usp=sharing|this guide>* and *<https://drive.google.com/file/d/1faPF4qdDpDYvhUgh5IRZr8yaHVapBKog/view?usp=sharing|this proposal form>*.

",message,
U010KDF9AVD,example_project_materials_proposal_phase,2020,10,21,2020-10-21,"• Find a project idea (if you don’t have one, go to channel <#C01364E7WBY|projectideas> to find newly hatched ideas or check the Slackmap on the channel #0_Welcome to find project ideas that have matured enough to have their own channel
• Find team mates (find them on <#C01364E7WBY|projectideas> or the *<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1boluXQ6QyWfAK6jMFHOlmfPfru9qD81N8mt6H5PLKoE/edit?usp=sharing|membership skills database>*:, or bring in new GCCR members from outside)
• Start a channel (and notify <@U010KDF9AVD> if you want your project channel to be listed in the Slack map)
• Prepare a project proposal with *<https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EDszuHbeJam2oeBHev4EnDwDzQnYOXA-/view?usp=sharing|this guide>* and *<https://drive.google.com/file/d/1faPF4qdDpDYvhUgh5IRZr8yaHVapBKog/view?usp=sharing|this proposal form>*. Probably your most helpful resource to figuring out some of the details are to refer to the existing GCCR preregistrations. For examples of preregistrations check out the channel #example_project_materials where we keep a collection of links or the *<https://osf.io/e68ns/wiki/10_projects/|projects>* wiki
• Submit project proposal to <@U010GME5DU4> or someone else on the leadership team, they will remove your team members names and pass the proposal on the study selection team (SST), who will send it out to reviewers. Currently the timelines have been pretty short for this, around a week, but this may take longer depending on how easy it is to find reviewers.
• Revise and resubmit if requested by the SST and agreed upon by the project team
• Write authorship agreement and ask for approval from the leadership team for the agreement. For examples of authorship agreements check out the channel #example_project_materials
• Post authorship agreement to membership in #key_anouncements channel. This is also a good time to introduce your project a little bit and ask for specific contributions if you need them.
• Create a preregistration on <http://osf.io|osf.io>. For examples of preregistrations check out the channel #example_project_materials where we keep a collection of links or the *<https://osf.io/e68ns/wiki/10_projects/|projects>* wiki. Notify the leadership team of your pregistration.
• Wait for a scheduled data tranche to be released (this will be communicated by the leadership team). In the mean time you may prepare for your data analyses by using an existing data tranche or by creating simulated data.
• Perform data analyses.
• Communicate deadlines. When your data analysis is done you want to start communicating approximate deadlines to your project team and to the rest of the GCCR membership if this is applicable. You can use the <#C01073JSVLZ|key_announcements> channel for those very essential messages that everyone should know about. We can also include something in an email message that goes out to all members (we do this very rarely only) and your project team can also present something or ask for contributions in a town hall meeting
• Create a form for authorship sign-up (if applicable). For examples of authorship sign-up forms, check out the channel #example_project_materials where we keep a collection of links
• Write paper
• Submit paper
• Share materials with <@U010KDF9AVD> to list for other projects to use as examples. This includes pre-registration, paper and code.

<@U010HHC57T2> made a good point in the leadership meeting today about including taste in the title. This will also be rectified. The FB group name can be edited to reflect this.

I'm glad that this FB group can be the public face of the GCCR on Facebook. I have a young colleague from Uni Reading, Aidan Kirkwood,  who has also worked with <@U010BFRJ8G3> and me on the parosmia study. Aidan has been stood down in his work and is now free to offer us his services to oversee the FB page. I can attest to his ability to fill this role, which will be time consuming.

_This group provides a forum to discuss the loss of smell and taste experienced either through Covid-19 or sudden smell loss during the Covid-19 period. The group is public outreach by the Global Consortium for Chemosensory Research. The GCCR is a recently established initiative that includes medical professionals, scientists, researchers, and health advocates from around the globe. We have convened in response to the current health emergency of Covid-19, and exist to further understand the role of smell and taste loss in this illness. We will be posting updates here on a daily basis._ 

The above text was prepared quickly and I am open to suggestions to improve it.

As of this morning, we have 230 members of the group. I have asked <@U010UMLP0D6> to prepare a 1-page report of soft observations on a weekly basis so that those who do not do FB can have an insight into what is happening on FB-GCCR.

I have been trying to wrap up the reports in the FB ""Covid-19 Smell and Taste Loss"". I dont have the numbers yet and I dont think I went through all yet (should have started immediately after the group started!!) but one thing I quickly noticed is that there are many reports from young people and especially many reports from women compared to men. I have been wondering if this reflects the characteristics of the patients' population or if there is a tendency that women feel easier to report on FB (I dont know! Just trying to think of possibilities). I also have an impression that they have mild symptoms, and some people even dont have symptoms other than anosmia and dysgeusia.

On the other hand, I am not finding an adequate validated questionnaire that measures food preferences in the literature.

The scale is also different as it uses the 9-point likert scale, which I know is less optimal but it is much easier to use.
I think apart from the nutritional qualities which I agree are important in terms of impact, the other issue is that we can’t really predict what has changed in terms of sensory properties, thus limiting to Fruit and Vegetables would risk missing out.
My biggest concern which I think would be the biggest issue is that people may not know their preference changed according to taste if they have not tasted something during lockdown. For instance one of the items is “sweet  coffee drinks” (starbucks like), in many places people will not have had the chance to taste any so may not know if their liking has changed. The same problems may have arisen with others as well. I am wondering if an open version of the liking questionnaire where people report which foods they realised changed and how much they liked them before and after would be a feasible solution. Of course it would mean lots of text mining and work.",message,

U010MSNP3FH,foodprefs,2020,05,28,2020-05-28,"Right, we need to be narrow and precise about the research question, not just throw out a preference survey and hope for some significant correlations.

Food intake is foremost a psychosocial experience (something us sensory scientists forget on occasion).

a) my senses were changed by covid which changing my liking, or
b) my entire social and work life has been violently disrupted?",message,

U0126DB8FU0,foodprefs,2020,06,04,2020-06-04,"Hi Emma and Elbrich, wellcome! Emma: OK, thank you, no problem. Maybe, food intake would also be an interesting variable to examine in patients with COVID-19. To all: Pamela Dalton let me know yesterday that: ""The change in the perception of food flavor [as a result of olfactory disfunctions, such as smell loss] leads some individuals to 'over eat' and gain weight, while others who no longer enjoy the sensation of food consumption stop eating and lose weight. Both of these are adverse outcomes"". My questions now are: 1) Does it make sense to examine changes in food consumption in patients with COVID-19, given their smell, taste and chemesthesis reductions/losses? 2) Or shall we just assume that the COVID-19 virus behaves as other viruses such as flu or cold behave? The second question is the most intriguint for me because if the answer to this question is yes, then, I think that we will not have much work to do, but, at the contrary, if the answer to that question is no, then, we have a lot to do, I think, but what do you think?",message,
U0126DB8FU0,foodprefs,2020,06,04,2020-06-04,"My particular answer to that question is that we just do not know it, but I also think that it would be interesting to ask this question to a virologist. Does any virologist belong to the GCCR consortium?",message,

U014SQ3UDC2,foodprefs,2020,06,04,2020-06-04,"Hi Paloma, I think it would be interesting to look at how food intake has changed specifically in COVID-19 patients since many are reporting that these changes last for some time afterwards, which is unlike other colds and flus. We are using a 24 recall tool for this, with longitudinal follow ups but this is an optional add on to our ongoing survey and not many have completed it.

Carla Mucignat, who has worked for several years in the field of neurovirology (infected the olfactory system and the brain with different viruses), has let me know the following input: “the common ’flu and COVID19 are caused by different viruses, on e is a coronavirus (for C19), while flu is caused by viruses from a different family (Orthomyxoviridae), while the common cold is caused by roughly 200 different viruses, usually Rhinoviruses. This means that they are different, and use different routes to enter into the cell because their surface proteins are different. For example, while there is vaccination for influenza (different every year), there is no vaccination for the common cold (and -up to now for COVID-19). Hence, it is not correct to apply to COVID-19 what we know about flu and cold.”",message,

I can chat with my collaborators about making the 24 hour recall tool available if possible to a wider study?. It is validated for a UK and Ireland population at present. I do think it would also be interesting to capture food liking, is there any information on the repeatability of these sorts of questionnaires over time? Would we expect to see food liking changes over time in the absence of Covid? Would we need to specifically ask whether liking for foods has changed, and if so what is the best way to that without leading the answers down a particular route. ",message,
U0126DB8FU0,foodprefs,2020,06,09,2020-06-09,"Hi Emma, that would be great if you could chat with your collaborators about making the 24 hour recall tool available if possible to a wider study. Maybe, we could use this tool as inspiration for elaborating a survey, although it is not validated in the 55 countries that belong to the consortium. The current survey has not been validated either, and it has been used by Parma et al., 2020 under review. In response to the question: Would we expect to see food liking changes over time in the absence of Covid? I can say that, to the best of my knowledge, in the absence of COVID -19, food liking changes are to be expected in: 1) Developing populations, such as children and older children through learning-related mechanisms, such as repeated exposure to foods and pavlovian conditioning. 2) From adolescence onwards through an increased nutritional knowledge. 3) There is also a study that has found decreased orange juice liking in adults after repeated exposure. In particular, these participants felt boredom after repeated exposure to that juice (8 times). 4) There is normal variation in taste perception, and this has been associated with differences in food liking, food preferences and nutritional status. 5) Food-based social comparisons influence food liking and consumption in young female adults. 6) Vegetarians's and/or vegans's moral restrictions regarding consumption of meat influences liking of meat in adults. In response to the question: is there any information on the repeatability of these sorts of questionnaires over time? If the questionnaire has been validated, there should be repeatability of these sorts of questionnaires over time to some extent. However, follow-up studies that are focused on food liking and normal, that is, disease-free, adults are scarce.",message,

I’m a clinical psychologist with expertise on olfaction impairment and social correlates in serious and persistent mental illness. I don’t have the extensive biomedical background to fully make sense of the following, but perhaps some of you do. I recognize (and ask you all to keep in mind) that what I am about to share is anecdotal, and possibly biased given my regular attention to the nose.

That said, I am presumed to have/had COVID-19 (OH is only testing people at high-risk and &gt;60 or healthcare workers so I have not been eligible to be tested. I was very ill (to varying degrees) for ~7 weeks. During that time, this was my observation (and cyclical): I’d have no sx, except a throbbing nose (sort of like a swollen lymph node), 2-3 days later my cough would return, my temp would spike, and I’d find an unusual amount of nasal hairs in my mouth, occasionally just falling out of my nose. I’d be very sick (sometimes going to the ED) for 5-6 days, then would  3-5 good days and it would start all over again. I only share this because the nasal hair loss and nasal throbbing have been bizarre and I don’t have the background to make sense of it. Of course I could just be atypical, but if my self-observations could help, it’s worth sharing.

I found it very inspiring and think that this is something that GCCR could really contribute to.
Here are some other replication study ideas:
•  radio waves evoking olfactory sensations - could do as online study with groups receiving different modality expectiotions, so visual, auditory, olfactory, somatosensory? Could address the idea/myth that olfaction is suggestible? -&gt; advantage is that this can be done as an online study, which is a nice choice while the pandemic is coming and going

That said, even with the strict cutoff (for the reasons above), we still have _thousands_ of completed surveys in just over a week since we launched.

Smell dysfunction: a biomarker for COVID‐19
AbstractBackground
SARS‐CoV‐2, the virus that causes COVID‐19 disease, is responsible for the largest pandemic since the 1918 H1N1 influenza outbreak. The symptoms presently recognized by the World Health Organization are cough, fever, tiredness, and difficulty breathing. Patient‐reported smell and taste loss has been associated with COVID‐19 infection, yet no empirical olfactory testing on a cohort of COVID‐19 patients has been performed.
Methods
The University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT), a well‐validated 40‐odorant test, was administered to 60 confirmed COVID‐19 inpatients and 60 age‐ and sex‐matched controls to assess the magnitude and frequency of their olfactory dysfunction. A mixed effects analysis of variance determined whether meaningful differences in test scores existed between the two groups and if the test scores were differentially influenced by sex.
Results
Fifty‐nine (98%) of the 60 patients exhibited some smell dysfunction [mean (95% CI) UPSIT score: 20.98 (19.47,22.48); controls: 34.10 (33.31,34.88); p&lt;0.0001]. Thirty‐five of the 60 patients (58%) were either anosmic (15/60; 25%) or severely microsmic (20/60; 33%); 16 exhibited moderate microsmia (16/60; 27%), 8 mild microsmia (8/60; 13%), and one normosmia (1/60; 2%). Deficits were evident for all 40 UPSIT odorants. No meaningful relationships between the test scores and sex, disease severity, or comorbidities were found.
Conclusions
Quantitative smell testing demonstrates that decreased smell function, but not always anosmia, is a major marker for SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and suggests the possibility that smell testing may help, in some cases, to identify COVID‐19 patients in need of early treatment or quarantine.",message,

U010H1EHW5S,important_links,2020,05,14,2020-05-14,"<@U010BNZ14KT> one of the challenges of those journals is that they want a combination of quality and novelty, plus a hook. GCCR001 definitely had the quality, and I would argue is still perhaps the most scientifically solid papers out there that have addressed the broad area of chemosensory loss in COVID-19. As to novelty, we had a problem. By the time we submitted, COVID-19-associated smell loss was already considered confirmed in many corners, though many details needed to be determined (indeed, the Spector paper was already on MedRxiv). GCCR001 addressed some of those details, including severity of smell loss and association with nasal obstruction. Of course, we also found substantial taste and chemesthesis loss. But taste loss fell into that same “we know that” bucket, and chemesthesis is too difficult a concept to convey in a nice snippet (our hook was too nuanced, unfortunately). For all those modalities, we were not able to address the issue of prevalence in COVID-19 or compare COVID to non-COVID, and thus could not speak to the diagnostic utility of smell, taste or chemesthesis loss. This last point is a major reason why Nature Medicine (or any other medical journal (except maybe a low impact ENT journal) was neither a fit nor a realistic option.",message,

I was curious to understand what criteria you felt we need to hit with GCCR002, particularly for those who may be pushing for the highest impact journals, and I think what you mentioned clearly lays that out. I also think that with the scope and scientific validity of our paper (or at least pending review), that we shouldn’t fear that the impact will be low for GCCR001 or it was a missed opportunity.  Particularly, with the large network of the GCCR and increasing attention towards ansomia, people will most definitely see it.

U011LB61P36,important_links,2020,05,14,2020-05-14,"I think there are several themes. I guess one important one is: Do we want to get into Nature XXX or do we want to run the study we think is interesting? The two may not combine necessarily.
Honestly to get into Nature xxx novelty is important but depth can be good as well. A few years ago I run a study on the genetics of baldness and got scooped not once but twice, same theme, same data, yet I still got into Nature Communications. I think mostly because my paper added a lot of insight the others didn’t. So if that’s where we want to go we need to think of more complex questions and answers which have not been given.
For example we use a quantitative measure of smell and taste loss compared to other studies, does this information add anything to our understanding of the disease? It seems to me that there are no patients who didn’t report some kind of change, while if you look at other work the prevalence is not so high. Is it because we capture also those patients which would not usually have a loss great enough to be considered anosmia?  Does combining smell taste and chemstesis gives us a better predictive power than just one? Is there any difference between countries which ties up with the different testing strategies etc etc. Do our results match those coming from others? It seems to me that almost all of our patients lost one sense or another.
I honestly thought that GCCR001 findings of clusters of patients was very interesting but to get into Nature we would have needed an explanation and some data supporting it, certainly not doable at this rate of progression.",message,
U010LKHD4RK,important_links,2020,05,14,2020-05-14,"The extensive replies are all very helpful and I agree. Guess what I don't understand, therefore, is why an inquiry was made to Nature Human Behaviour. Wrong journal. But let't not dwell. I am hugely devoted to Chemical Senses, and it is a very rigorous journal. I just wonder whether we'll get the usual treatment from others outside the chemosensory community who may regard it as quite niche. We're all on the same side here.

Indeed. Though as you mentioned, the depth of inquiry that “glamorous” journals may require reframing how one considers their study (and analysis). My group has a paper under review at Nature now and while extensive work,  the sub-questions that have to be derived and the extra steps involved have really driven the understanding and curiosity of that work.
The rapid pace of GCCR001 very likely would have prevented the depth required, and that’s completely okay. Though maybe for the next paper, particularly with the increase of other studies now in this area, to find the most interesting answers it may err in our favor to think with that degree of extended scope. Even regardless of where we want it to be placed.

Very very good conversation, at least for me. Thanks all.",message,

yes we agree it’s critical to move forward in an organized manner. Masha, Marga and myself discussed to bring it up in the meeting. But if you all think it’s best to create those designations here. That is fine too. My hope is that some people will volunteer to lead. Do we want to think of some ideas for structure?  I see this different from ISOT and ACHEMS since it would be research collaboration efforts. Thoughts? 


These are my thoughts: 

1. A lead from each country 
2. A website 
3. Regulations on how data would be shared if someone wants access 
4. Consortium members publications and authorship 
5. Someone who can share funding sources 
6. Research ideas as a group
7. We will need an actual board.
1. And much more... 
Of course we need everyone’s expertise who have a better idea on how these things run :blush:",message,

A couple of people in Sweden who either is or has been infected by the virus have reached out to me via email/phone for advice given their percieved inability to smell/taste. I asked to some home testing to isolate what their problem is. A total of 17 people did the home test and all of them reported being unable to smell odors, 3 unable to sense oral trigeminal components, and 2 no taste. However, I am not sure if the two latter categories used good products and did what I asked them to do. This, of course, demonstrates nothing. But it does indicate that it will be especially important to test whether they can taste something or not since (as we all know), a large degree of ""unable to taste"" probably is due to anosmia/hyposmia.",message,

Another issue is that digital questionnaire is not good enough option if we are interested in getting as many of COVID19 infected or suspected patients in this study.

:point_down:Please read carefully below

• Please if you have not done so already, please *sign the agreement* here: <https://forms.gle/1tgC7K7kytZQPjTw6> it is paramount to determine the countries represented in the consortium. 
• The first draft of the questionnaire is now submitted to the #test_questionnaire_draf1. It will be open for pilot testing and comments by a group of self-elected volunteers for the next 3 hours (sorry if this timing is inconvenient to some of you, this is in the interest of moving fast). Once this step is optimized, the final version of the questionnaire will be posted in the #global channel.


:stopwatch: Meanwhile…
* *
• *Select a country leader* and communicate it to me ASAP <@U010GME5DU4> or <mailto:valentina.parma@temple.edu|valentina.parma@temple.edu>
• The country leader should include themselves in the *<#C010G3PTSQZ|country_leaders> channel*
• *Translate the questionnaire by country*. Include the translation team in one thread to keep track of contribution. Some countries may share languages with other groups (e.g., Switzerland). Please, touch base with the groups that are working on translations in the same language so that we have one translation per language.
* *
• *Back-translation* allows us to compare translations with the original content for accuracy and quality. To achieve that select one person per country (proficient in English) who does not participate in the first round of the translation, but acts as a back translator. The back translation does not have to be identical to the original English version of the questionnaire, but differences will help to identify any errors, ambiguities or confusion that may arise from the nuances of language. The country group will vote on the version to present.
• Once the back translation is complete, please communicate it to me and *include your translation in the #core_questionnaire_back channel*",message,

• you mention spiciness only at the end, is it normal? if yes fine , i m fine

*From <@U010MSNP3FH> :*

Given the need for speed, we are _not_ coordinating the protocol across multiple sites and multiple IRBs in multiple countries, as that would take weeks even under normal circumstances, and things are obviously not normal.

Instead, we are writing a single site IRB protocol out of my lab in the US that should be compliant with both California privacy rules and GDPR regulations. We are using Compusense, a Canadian data collection platform that is well versed in both CA and GDPR rules (and their servers are located in Canada as well).

The really good news is that our current path forward (exempt versus expedited protocol) means that _we do not need to have the individual translated surveys approved individually_.  On the landing page for the survey, participants will be given an option to select their local language. (This is very routine with global consumer goods companies).

*I may reach out if if we need help translating consent language for localized pages.*  :bangbang:*PLEASE CHOOSE YOUR COUNTRY LEADER AND TELL THEM TO ACCESS THE <#C010G3PTSQZ|country_leaders> CHANNEL*:bangbang:  Communication about translation of consent will be posted there.

U010K0C9JKT,key_announcements,2020,03,29,2020-03-29,"So here’s the summary of what I was told by UChicago docs, a neurologist and neuropathologist. The medical examiner has jurisdiction over all COVID-19 deaths, and there are specific methods and restrictions over what kinds of saws are allowable, suction, etc. on autopsies, for good reason. The area of the cranium that they have to go through to get the tissue we would like to see has a very high viral load. Anecdote out of China from my colleague:
“An ENT team was doing a trans-sphenoidal pituitary resection, and the entire OR team contracted the virus and died (at least that’s what a local ENT told me). The viral density in the oropharyngeal area is high and risk to anesthesiologists, surgeons, respiratory therapists and pathologists working in that area is very high. Presumably that risk would carry over to researchers working with tissue from that area. How would you transport, store and use that tissue safely?”
So, I think we have to think a bit smaller here and ask teams that may be saving brain tissue to save the olfactory bulbs and cortex. We will need to get people on board who can do the kind of histology that is needed and also have good biosafety facilities to do it with.",message,

Then variations:
• they do get other symptoms (one had stronger fever after going surfing coz after the first small fever and “just” losing sense of smell he didn’t think it was coronavirus at all so went around and about but after few days he was sweating strong fever at night, could not run as usual for no breath, one had some coughing,...
• appetite: one couldn’t eat no appetite, whereas one could not stop eating, really hungry all the time.
• one mentions itch/burning in the nose at some point

Every article starts by saying loss of smell is well known in other viral deseases or in this article “many other viruses can cause the same effect”.
• do these deseases have “loss of smell” as official symptoms?  
• was there a formal clinical study specifically run on each one to make all the other COVID19 symptoms “official”?
• IS THERE actually at least ONE other known viral disease whereby a) so many patients suffer a loss of smell b) as part of the very few early alarming symptoms , c) a total loss that occurrs very abruptly (from one day to next: all gone !! even checked and rechecked in different ways by somepatients in the fragrance industry, they were freaking out) c) remains total loss for about a whole week and d) comes back, in flashes, not gradually, and takes another week to come back?

That said, we didn't design the initial survey toward that goal. Instead, we focused on people with recent respiratory illnesses (flu, cold, covid) so we could answer the question of whether covid was uniquely targeting  chemosensory function. As such, covid negative colds and flu become our control group.

Obviously, this _choice_ doesn't fully capture the otherwise asymptomatic people, or those who already recovered. We recognize this is a limitation and we hope to role out additional tools, questionnaires and studies, but we had to pick somewhere to start.

If you answer no the question “Within the past two weeks, have you been diagnosed with or suspect that you have respiratory illness?” This will, of course, screen away non-covid-19 individuals (but also the about 30% of C19 individuals that lack respiratory/cough problems) and allow the survey to focus on individuals that has C19 with a higher certainty. The problem with this though is that we then lack a “control group”. A lot of the recruitment now specifically mention loss of smell and taste and posting has been done in social groups dedicated to smell/taste loss. It can therefore be expected that we will have a skewed recruitment that attract individuals that do experience these symptoms. It would have been nice to have some sort of baseline for how many of these individuals we are attracting. An example is the survey from Kings College where their non-C19 individuals complained about loss of smell/taste in much larger numbers than what is to be expected in the normal population, therefore serving as some form of measure of how many of certain groups you attract.
 Note that I am *not* arguing that the survey should be changed at this point but this is something that should be considered when assessing and publishing the data – especially if the number of individuals with anosmia are very high.

*Re: skewing,* partly it will be inevitable due to the heightened attention of the media on chemosensory loss and COVID-19, partly because COVID-19 is pervasive now, and partly because the survey comes from us, heavily connected to chemosensory issues. This is why it is extremely important that we all communicate that we want to *reach out to anybody who has ANY respiratory illnesses and not only those with smell and taste complaints and or diagnosed COVID-19.* The tweets and communication that we are further developing are specifically targeting this point. Meanwhile, particularly those active in social media, please spread this message.

*re: asymtomatic carriers.* This is one of the focal points of the self-assessment (with longitudinal observations), which is almost done.

Just eye-balling the data looks significant to me (though I'm sure there are others who'd know better than I whether it is). Also, the article doesn't mention that while flu and cold symptoms can lead to temporary smell loss, the notable cases, increasingly reported right now, are those who suffer sudden smell loss with no nasal obstruction. Yes, other viruses can cause this. But right now? In the countries where infection rate are going up?

For this reason a control group composed of people with no symptoms what so ever would have been good.
I may have miss-understood this point and my comment is of little help.

Christophe,

Thank you for supporting and pushing forward the University of Pennsylvania initiative linked to specific sensory symptoms related to COVID-19.  Both my husband and I completed the survey, because we had mild cases of COVID-19 and experienced the sensory symptoms identified in your email.  We are very fortunate to have had mild cases.  However, our loss of smell and taste was vivid and palpable.  As a result, I lost 6# and my husband lost 10#, over the course of 5 days.  Nothing tasted good to us and we had to force ourselves to eat half a portion of home-prepared, healthy, primarily vegetarian dishes.  Beverages were completely different, from coffee to wine.  We were delighted to be asked to participate in the survey, especially since we did not have to do it from a berth in a refrigerated truck.  As is now obvious, breathing and smelling are the essence of the life force.

We now have a <https://gcchemosensr.org/surveys/|multilingual survey page> on the GCCR website that lands in language specific pages, in which all the content is in the language of the survey.

For instance if you want to advertise the survey to Norwegians, you can give the following link: <https://gcchemosensr.org/surveys/nb/>

Spanish? Use this: <https://gcchemosensr.org/surveys/es/>

In the multilingual page you will find the languages deployed so far. If there are some delays, the volunteers who manage the webpage may be asleep :slightly_smiling_face: or the content is still in translation phase.

You can find the first draft of the manuscript up to the results section <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zUfu7ekmaYeko-3sCne0AsxEHBydCcYxbOiZhu1jui4/edit?usp=sharing|here>.

*What is missing?*
• Comment the written sections. In this phase, please focus on providing major inputs. If you like the sections as they are now, add a comment of approval. If you see typos or opportunity for rephrasing, make sure you are tracking your changes.
• Discussion: claim the part that you would like to write, as done for the introduction.
• Figures: help us perfect them joining the questionnaire-data-analysis channel. We will post there the specific requests.
• Check the code: replicate and clarify the R script. Please join the questionnaire-data-analysis channel and provide your brief report and potential edits.
*When is my contribution due?*
The possibility to edit/contribute is open till *April 27th 8pm ET (48 hours).*

*Authorship?*

We are not the first, nor the biggest, but we are the most comprehensive.

Dear all,

To make sure that all who want to contribute to the GCCR001 paper have the chance to do so, we are reopening the possibility to become an author.

Remember that:
*Authorship on the GCCR001 project does not guarantee authorship on other projects.*

To be an author on the GCCR001 project, you need to:
1. Contribute to data collection or another CRediT taxonomy category.
2. Contribute to writing, revising, and editing the final manuscript.
Based on the CRediT taxonomy, “Writing - Review and Editing” will be the most relevant contribution category for most authors. This category minimally requires reading the manuscript, providing relevant feedback and suggested edits, and confirming approval of submission. “Validation” includes writing-review. Most authors will contribute to “Investigation” and “Writing - Review & Editing.”

Two categories of contribution are mandatory to be considered as author, yet we ask you to be as accurate as possible in reporting the extent of your contribution.

 Dear :page_with_curl: GCCR001 Authors,

Thanks for the many insightful comments and edits to this first manuscript. Many were integrated into this “final” version. As you will recall from the authorship agreement, you now have 24 hours to read and approve this paper for submission. If you do not approve and wish to be removed as an author, you must let the leadership team know within this window of time. Specifically, please tag <https://gccr-mql6351.slack.com/team/U01061WU4F5|@Danielle Reed> and <https://gccr-mql6351.slack.com/team/U010KDF9AVD|@Maria Veldhuizen> in Slack to communicate your desire to remove yourself as an author. Otherwise, we will assume that you still approve and wish to be an author. Limited edits/suggestions (especially typos or red flags) are welcome, but no more edits are expected at this time.

:bangbang:*You have until 6 AM Monday May 4, 2020 to provide your comments and questions*:bangbang:

:mega: If you are aware of colleagues that are included yet may not check Slack often, please inform them.

The plan is to finalize the manuscript on Monday May 4, 2020 night ET time and to submit it to _MedRxiv_ and to _Chemical Senses_ that day.

The _*choice of Chemical Senses*_ has been based on two pieces of information:

1. We had submitted a pre-submission inquiry to Nature Human Behavior, which was considered by the Editorial Office, yet not sent out for review because “not of immediate interest to our broad audience of human behavior researchers”. 
2. The responses to the last authorship agreement indicate that 69.5% of the respondents agreed with the journal suggestion of _Chemical Senses_ for submission, and an additional 18.3% neither agreed nor disagree with this option. 
_*Publicity*_ will begin on Tuesday, May 5, assuming that the preprint has posted to MedRxiv after undergoing initial QC checks. The Penn State University Media Team will coordinate publicity and media outreach. If you institution would like to help and to coordinate, please provide contact information for your media team to <https://gccr-mql6351.slack.com/team/U010MSNP3FH|@John Hayes>.

 As you will recall, we used the CREDIT taxonomy to assess contributions and determine authorship order. A four-tier system was employed. However, we have run into some practical issues that we did not anticipate (though perhaps should have).
1. Most biomedical journals (including _Chemical Senses_, the _JAMA_ family, _BMJ_and the _PLoS_ journals) use the ICJME criteria for authorship. They are:
• Substantial contributions to the conception or design of the work; or the acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data for the work; AND
• Drafting the work or revising it critically for important intellectual content; AND
• Final approval of the version to be published; AND
• Agreement to be accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are appropriately investigated and resolved. ",message,

U010WRRC91A,key_announcements,2020,05,03,2020-05-03,"Good job everyone ! A few comments:
• As <@U010V9B9K5H> mentionned, the caption of fig5A (p.28) says ""Clinical Assessment in blue and Lab Test in red"" but both are green on the plot.
• fig6B (p.29): In the caption, dimension 1 (smell and taste loss) is said to be on the x-axis, but on the plot it corresponds to the y-axis. Same for dimension 2. Also, using ""abscissa"" and ""ordinate"" as in fig5, instead of x and y, would make more sense to me.
• chemosensory clustering and fig6B (p.28 and 29): I think there's a mismatch between the clusters numerotation and colors (and possibly their interpretation). The green cluster (Cluster 1) is said to have N=1767, which is roughly the same N as cluster 2 (blue), but that doesn't seem to correspond in the scatterplot: to me it looks like blue and orange cluster have N=1700, and green cluster has N=550. Their also seem to be a mismatch in the characterisation of the level of smell/taste loss between the clusters based on the centroids: for cluster 1, ""substantial"" loss for both centroids around -85, ""moderate"" for cluster 2 for centroids of -87 for smell and -65 for taste, but ""substantial"" again for cluster 3 for both centroids around -20.",message,
U010MD7FVQB,key_announcements,2020,05,03,2020-05-03,"●Minor comment:
Participant numbers in Fig 2:
In the legend, it is stated as ""the number of observations included or excluded at each step of the evaluation process is indicated"".
In the figure, there are two diagram boxes that state ""Removed"" (i.e., ""Incomplete Data Removed (n =18087)"" and ""No COVID-19 Data Removed (n=8267)"". Considering the numbers, former one seem to indicate remaining number of observations. Is the later one indicate removed number of observations? If both are remaining number of observations, legend should be corrected. Otherwise, it would be better to keep it consistent (i.e., both “incomplete Data” and “NoCoVID-19 Data” should show removed n.).

• One bias that is not mentioned in the discussion, but may be relevant would be the fact that our survey may have inadvertently been advertised and taken by people who experienced chemosensory loss during their infection.  Our explicit objectives to measure chemosensory loss may have inflated the numbers at little.

• In the method section (p12), related to the core questionnaire, perhaps good to add the nasal blockage question to ""participants were asked to quantify their ability to xxx"" as well as add the anchors for the VAS used (not at all-completely blocked; no sense of xx - excellent sense of xx), also in light of that the nasal blockage question was phrased 'opposite' to the others (thus, mean ratings have to be interpreted differently)",message,

U010K0HFFTN,key_announcements,2020,05,04,2020-05-04,"Hi all,
the paper looks great!
I have the following comments :
• There is something wrong with the clustering analysis. According to centroids values, I think the following description (Fig. 6, p.28-29) of cluster 2 and 3 should be reversed : _""Cluster 2 (N = 1724) is 29 characterized by ratings reflecting moderate smell/taste loss and unaffected chemesthesis (centroids: smell: -87.81, taste: -65.97, chemesthesis: -11.07). Cluster 3 (N = 548) is characterized by ratings reflecting substantial smell and taste loss, and preserved chemesthesis (centroids: smell: -24.33, taste: -20.97, chemesthesis: -6.87).""_  
• in figure 6.B, x and y axis are confusing. I'm not familiar with the _fviz_cluster_ function but if I understand well, x and y axis should be PC1 and PC2 respectively. However, according to panel A, the main contribution to PC1 is not chemestesis alone. Maybe I'm wrong but does that mean that axis labels are not correct?
• I also find a small typo p.9 : _nasopharynx_ instead of _nasopharnyx_.",message,

Dear :page_with_curl:* *GCCR001 Authors,

as of yesterday night (~ 12am ET) we submitted the GCCR001 paper to <http://medrxiv.org|medrxiv.org> and to Chemical Senses. :tada:

Now, keep your fingers crossed!:crossed_fingers:

CURRENTLY, THE PAPER IS NOT PUBLICLY AVAILABLE.

We are waiting on the medRxiv screening for that to happen. *One important note*: to speed up the submission process *to <http://medrxiv.org|medrxiv.org> ONLY*, we have not listed all authors by name at this stage. The authors on the leadership team are mentioned by name (it was necessary to have at least a corresponding author). All authors are however included in the first page of the manuscript as of now, as per submission to Chemical Senses.
*As soon as the submission is approved by medrxiv, we will request to make an update and upload all the names of the authors singularly.* 

In contrast, the submission to *Chemical Senses* has all authors up to 99 listed as authors and the others listed as collaborators under the GCCR author label, as agreed.

We thank you for your cooperation during this, somewhat unusual, process.
Stay tuned for further updates!",message,

*RAISE AWARENESS ""I CARE"" - CALL FOR ACTION* :mega:

COVID-19 has powerfully brought smell and taste disorders in the eye of the general public, who is starting to recognize words like anosmia more easily than ever before.

*We ask the GCCR members to  contribute to raise awareness of invisible conditions such as smell and taste disorders.* 

With your help, we want to create a 30s video (tweetable!) that sends a powerful message to address a common complaint that patients have: ""Researchers and doctors do not care"". Let's gather together and show that this is not the case. For a detail on the video concept, please check the pdf attached.

*How you can help:*
1. Send us a head and shoulders photograph of yourself. Please avoid white backgrounds as the images will be overlain with white text in some cases. The photo should be in a square format (we can crop). You should be square to camera. Feel free to wear clothing that says something about your profession, your country of origin, or anything about yourself that you would like to convey that is in line with the GCCR mission. 72dpi is fine, with the image minimum 300 x 300pixels.

2. Send us an audio clip of yourself saying “I care” in your native language. On Android phones, recording apps are not always included but many have them. On iPhone use the free version of Voice Memos.

3. Upload your photo and audio clips here, being sure to include your name in the file.
Example: MarySmith_audio/JohnDoe_photo

Dear All,

After the submission of GCCR001, we are focusing on the next steps and we are glad that such a big and diverse group of people can contribute to chemosensory science and to the understanding of COVID-19.

*Communication on GCCR001:* 
You are welcome to use the example of a press release to promote the pre-print of the GCCR001 paper that is attached in the word document. We aim at boosting the number of responses (please also, check out <@U010H1EHW5S>'s message here <https://gccr-mql6351.slack.com/archives/C01073JSVLZ/p1589145153447200>).

*Self-Assessment update:*
After having encountered some technical issues, the self-assessment has been resubmitted for revisions to the IRB and it is about to be beta tested by a selected group of patients that the GCCR Patient Advocacy Committee (PAC) has identified. It will be soon made available to the whole membership for feedback. The translation process will start with the final version. Thank you for your patience and stay tuned for updates!

*Study proposals:*
Part of the GCCR mission is to encourage and facilitate global collaboration in concert with local collaboration across countries, labs, scientists and clinicians interested in the chemical senses. Besides the research projects that involve the whole GCCR, we invite all GCCR members (aka those who have already signed the GCCR agreement which is still available <https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeNN2yTh3xKG5426W2wpCZlPjr4yiYZWfMJMwq8xPQlBs-NqA/viewform?usp=sf_link|here>) to contribute projects proposals. Please, review the pdf attached for detailed information.

Please address the submission of the proposals to me by EXCLUSIVELY using the documents presented. I will blind the proposals and send them to the Study Selection Team (SST), composed of (in alphabetical order): <@U011X3FBYTU>, <@U010HKT9NAH>, <@U010HPXMLM6>, <@U010SGDUGN4>, <@U010LKVJ6T1>, <@U010QKW7C9K>, <@U010NCMR6QL>, <@U0107DF9NQH>, who will first screen the proposal and identify reviewers. Once the proposal is accepted, the project team is in charge of pre-registering the study and draft an authorship agreement for the project.

We thank <@U010DH278RZ>, <@U010QUTMW4V>,<@U010SQ9CD9V>,  <@U010L9KCNFR> and other team members for having  contacted  the leadership team with a time-sensitive research proposal, which aims at providing input to governmental policy in France based on the GCCR data. Their request offered a perfect opportunity to trouble-shoot the study proposal process that we had outlined.

We look forward to your submissions and to the great science that the GCCR can produce.

Best,

Valentina on behalf of the Leadership Team",message,

Dear All,

A few pieces of news and appointments to be marked on your calendar.

*Get ready for more work: GCCR002 is coming*
Tomorrow ET we will have a new tranche of the data available, and the works for GCCR002 will start. We have pre-registered the analyses <https://osf.io/aucp9|here> and in the file attached. The author agreement will be available by Friday May 15th to share the expectations on authorship, collaborations and contributions for GCCR002. A later author effort assessment will be shared to record contributions. 

As for GCCR001, things will be happening fast. So please inform people that may not be constantly checking Slack and, if possible, create ways to inform colleagues by country of the messages regarding the paper. Country leaders, we count on your help to keep the members of your channels up to date with the various deadlines. Thank you in advance. 


*New data tranche, more possibilities for projects*
We are glad to see the first project submissions coming in. Please, keep them coming!


*The GCCR global potential*
One of the GCCR strengths that sets us apart from many other similar research enterprises is that our research project is *global*. Increasing the number of responses at the questionnaire across countries will increase the possibility of the GCCR level studies as well as of all the studies that the membership can propose.

_How can you help:_ 
• Reach out to your contacts in all possible languages and send them the survey;
• As a member of the GCCR, please take credit for the work that you are doing! Contact your media department, tell them that you are part of the author or part of the GCCR and have them cover your role in the GCCR and the results of GCCR001. 
• Spread the results of the GCCR001 paper on social media, via tweets, facebook posts, creating a Tik Tok video that highlights the information in the abstract,... Get creative! 

*Town hall Monday May 18th 1pm ET*
In the town hall, we'd like to i) take a moment to cherish the submission of GCCR001 and discuss its results; ii) discuss about GCCR002; iii) review the study proposal mechanisms together.

A more detailed agenda will be issued later, but please mark your calendars as of now! For those who are unable to join the town hall, a recording will be provided.

Stay tuned for the next steps and looking forward to seeing you on Monday.
Best,

Valentina, on behalf of the Leadership Team",message,

*Making human chemosensory research more reproducible: learning from the renaissance in psychology*
 Speaker: Tristram Wyatt 
*Abstract:*  Research on the human sense of smell often explores subtle effects but with small-scale experiments: across the rest of psychology, typically only 50-70 % of small-scale experiments can be replicated. Human chemosensory research would benefit from adopting the proposals made by psychologists to enable better, more reliable science, with an emphasis on enhancing reproducibility. Key tools are study pre-registration and/or Registered Reports which will also reduce publication bias. These approaches are being used by the new Global Consortium for Chemosensory Research (GCCR). To illustrate the problems and some solutions, I will use the story of the “putative human pheromones” androstadienone and estratetraenol which, despite never having been shown to be pheromones, have been the subject of some 60 studies claiming ‘significant’ positive results.
      Background: Wyatt, TD (2020) Reproducible research into human chemical communication by cues and pheromones: learning from psychology's renaissance. _Phil Trans RS B_ 375: <https://uksemiochemistry.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=ffbe8f007fa13d03f0eaf0f54&amp;id=a3641bc0f4&amp;e=a6945d0383|20190262>.

here is an end of the week update.

*SELF CHECK*
Things are moving and the *self check* (or hometest) is its website version will soon be ready for testing. <#C012ZQJCE11|patient_advocacy_pac> (<@U010H1EC3J8>, <@U010N34GLU8>, <@U012JJFTKNU> in particular) please, also alert the contacts who have previously commented on the self check and see if they are willing to have a second pass on this version. Stay tuned on a message in the coming days in this channel. 
:heavy_exclamation_mark:*Action: get ready to review the self check*
:exclamation:*Action for pac: alert your contacts*

*TRANSLATION*
The goal is to deploy with the initial languages of English and German next week. The self-check can be *translated* in other languages and be included in the website. As we have already experience, this requires a lot of work. We are trying to make it as painless as possible thanks to <@U010KM0A4KG> and <@U012S7NGVA7>, but we will still need to manage the effort and it will take time.
:exclamation:*Action: Country leaders* gather these pieces of information and then complete the <https://forms.gle/mWhTNcmTZNMMy7wdA|following google form>.

• Would you like to translate the self-check tool in your language?
• Please specify the language
• Have you already identified the team who will translate from English to your language?
• List the names of the people here, each separated by a comma
• Have you already identified the team who will BACK translate from your language to English?
• List the names of the people here, each separated by a comma
• Who is the dedicated person that will coordinate the translation, the back translation and is in charge of the communication with the GCCR translation team?
*GCCR002*
We are still working hard on GCCR002 and we hope to have soon figures to show. We've been deeply diving into the data this time and it's big and complex database. Bare with us!

*STUDY PROPOSALS*
Remember to submit your study proposals as EDS (Existing data studies) with the current available data, or a NDS (New data studies), if you want to propose the GCCR to collect additional data.

Dear R and Python :male_mage:(wizards),

attached is the folder with the replicable version of *GCCR001*. Can you please check that it works before we post it in OSF for the world to see?

Thank you to <@U011BFNUL78> who has already cross checked and included the edits from the revision process.

I'm sure there are many more of you who have R experience which I have not fully appreciated yet, but I drop a line to those who contributed to the code: <@U010SS42QQ3>, <@U011LB61P36>, <@U010SGDUGN4> and <@U010JNDUXS9> and those whom I know are R enthusiasts: <@U010KDF9AVD>, <@U011RGE8J3D>, <@U013CSP9CR1>, <@U013E19DNSF>, <@U010XM0J9Q8>.

<@U010MTQU5PX>, after this last check this will be the  *final_final* version. We did not make changes to the analyses so I believe your Python translation is already accurate, but please double check or ask here for another pair of eyes.

Once this process is conclude (ideally tomorrow), <@U010KDF9AVD> can you please post on OSF and make the project public once _Chemical Senses_ has publish it online?

:mega: *For ALL: reconnect with your communication office and with the press who wanted to see these data peer-reviewed before talking about it: it's an opportunity to keep the survey in people's minds and prepare them for out next contributions.*

*Making human chemosensory research more reproducible: learning from the renaissance in psychology*
Speaker: Tristram Wyatt 
*Abstract:*  Research on the human sense of smell often explores subtle effects but with small-scale experiments: across the rest of psychology, typically only 50-70 % of small-scale experiments can be replicated. Human chemosensory research would benefit from adopting the proposals made by psychologists to enable better, more reliable science, with an emphasis on enhancing reproducibility. Key tools are study pre-registration and/or Registered Reports which will also reduce publication bias. These approaches are being used by the new Global Consortium for Chemosensory Research (GCCR). To illustrate the problems and some solutions, I will use the story of the “putative human pheromones” androstadienone and estratetraenol which, despite never having been shown to be pheromones, have been the subject of some 60 studies claiming ‘significant’ positive results.

Dear <!channel>,

GCCR001 has been published online at Chemical Senses. Please do not publicize yet, since we have found one code mistake on the last figure (no change in the conclusions though) that has already been approved by the Editor Don Wilson as a change to be edited in the proofs. The production at Chemical Senses has already been warned and we expect this to be rectified soon.

We will inform you as soon as the proofs are available and the paper in its final form is produced.

:tada:*LAUNCH OF GCCR SELF-CHECK*:tada:

Dear <!channel>,

the English version of the self-check is now live!
You can find it at <https://gcchemosensr.org/>
One chooses the language they want to complete the test in, they will be asked a one multiple choice question to direct them to the right GCCR tool.

The question is phrased as follows:

1. I am currently sick with a respiratory illness (COVID-19, flu, cold) 
2. I am currently have been sick in the past two weeks with a respiratory illness (COVID-19, flu, cold)
3. I have been sick with a respiratory illness (COVID-19, flu, cold) more than 2 weeks ago
4. I have been sick and now I want to monitor my sense of smell and taste
5. I am healthy, but want to monitor my sense of smell and taste

The first 2 options will redirect to the survey. Option 3-5 to the self-check.

Please, *SPREAD THE WORD.*

• Contact your press office, local journalists. <@U010TQQ3W6Q> was so kind to draft a new press release for all of us. 
• Follow the trends of spread of COVID and of the flu in your country and make an effort to target those area and their local news outlets.
• Share on social media weekly
• Create interactive content (gifs, short videos to share)
• Contact all of the people that reported smell and taste loss to you directly. 
• Find alternative ways to test individuals who would not otherwise participate in these online tools.

*TESTING VULNERABLE POPULATIONS*
We would like to bring your attention to the following appropriately recognize the inclusion of vulnerable populations. If you are planning to test participants via face-to-face interview or via telephone interview because they do not have access to the survey, or because they may be illiterate (among other reasons), you need to describe such methods in your IRB application. These methods are not included in the current approved IRBs.",message,

:exclamation:*GCCR002 draft*:exclamation:

Dear <!channel>,

It took longer than expected but here is the *first GCCR002 draft*.
Thanks to <@U010MTQU5PX> and the leadership team, we thoroughly explored the data set up to May 14th (the one available to all, which we refer to as GCCR data tranche #2).

In <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MnoopjsN1bSPJHq647A_Vi-eoJxias8k5O9z_Ww70Hk/edit?usp=sharing|this google docs>, you can find an outline based on our current understanding of the data, as well as figures with captions.

*How to work on the shared document?* 
• Figures and captions are a work in progress, there many details are not final. Please point to *major* changes. 
• Claim parts to write based on the outline, and include comments if you see *major* arguments to deviate from it. Extensive descriptions of the olfactory and gustatory systems are unlikely to make it to the final draft. 
• Keep in mind that your contribution should be mindful of the total length a paper. 
• Include the citations that you include in your writing as comments. They will be included in the Zotero GCCR bibliography. To request access to it, write to <@U010XM0J9Q8>. 
*The goal is to write this article for a medical audience, with a rather broad readership.* 

*Timeline:* 
• Writing from members by July 3rd
• LT homogenizes the writing and includes edits by July 7th
• Members will edit a new version and complete the authorship agreement (to refresh your memory, t<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uAfGHrr1SjYwxBKinHuR7SshmsCccbZ-_EpsrdGgZN8/edit?usp=sharing|he authorship agreement looks like this>)  July 9th
• Expected submission: July 13th.

Please, inform those who may not check Slack about the current expected timeline, and when the contributions are due and the authorship agreement is expected to be signed.

Let the work on #2 begins!

Best,

U010KDF9AVD,key_announcements,2020,07,01,2020-07-01,":question:*“Did you know?” …. that we have a code of conduct (COC)?*

When we started the GCCR we made it one of our goals to be inclusive and diverse. This is particularly important because we want to be global. One of the principles to foster awareness and facilitate more equitable participation is the following:
  
&gt; “Set expectations for appropriate behavior and create structures of accountability in the event of inappropriate behavior.” <https://500womenscientists.org/inclusive-scientific-meetings|Source>
(This is a source that I have found useful, but let’s make it explicit that we don’t specifically prioritize _only_ women as a URM, and that there are groups that need far more support, especially at the intersection of groups).

When you became a member, you acknowledged to abide by the GCCR Code of Conduct in any of the GCCR spaces.

We wanted to take a moment to remind you of the code of conduct and how you may report someone that is not abiding by our code of conduct. You can find our COC <https://gccr-mql6351.slack.com/archives/C013BD495MM/p1589633343153200|here> and you can find our anonymous reporting form <https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc2frrQjH69jfpgIZDcHamT--LWsPFa34qiCvn_ERkEZYUwxA/viewform|here>. You can also always reach out to anyone on the leadership team. <@U010MSNP3FH>; <@U0107D4SH25> l; <@U010H1EC3J8>; <@U010H1EHW5S>; <@U010HHC57T2>; <@U010KM0A4KG>; <@U010GME5DU4>  (chair); <@U01061WU4F5>; <@U010KDF9AVD>

All organizations need constant work on inclusiveness, diversity and equity and we are no exception. We just got started, so we don’t have many structures in place yet. But this can also be an advantage, because well… we don’t have to change many existing structures.

We are invested in working on other principles on fostering awareness and facilitating more equitable participation so stay tuned for more message and initiatives.:hourglass_flowing_sand:

U010GME5DU4,key_announcements,2020,07,02,2020-07-02,"*IMPORTANT UPDATE GCCR002* 

Dear <!channel>,

The database we are using for GCCR002 has been queried more than a month ago, so a lot has happened since then.

Considering our rather low numbers in the C19- group (N = 410 after data cleaning lower than the minimal pre-registered 480), we felt that some of our predictive models could be strengthened by having more C19- (or we could be proven wrong, in which case we still may want to know before publication!).

Therefore, we have just pre-registered an additional study (pdf attached), reporting that we have explored the data as of May 14th (as discussed in the previosu preregistration; <https://osf.io/aucp9>) and included an additional question on recovery that was not present in the previous pre-registration.

The new data tranche will be made available as soon as it downloaded, checked for multiple responses, and cleaned for the country field. Part of this process is manual, so it may take a few days. We will inform you and the data will be posted at the same old location in the GCCR shared drive.

*Does this mean that we are going to be terribly delayed on the paper?*
Likely, no. All the people involved in the download and cleaning of the database have been alerted and the code is ready to be rerun exactly as it is now. You are writing, the LT is currently working on streamlining the content and editing, based on your updates on the text.

*Does this mean that we should stop writing now ?*
No. Thank you to those of you who have already contributed to <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MnoopjsN1bSPJHq647A_Vi-eoJxias8k5O9z_Ww70Hk/edit?usp=sharing|this> working file. As soon as we have the new results, we will post the new figures, but the intro and the useful information that you are collecting for the discussion should remain rather similar and have already proven very useful.

More updates as soon as they are available,

The LT has done their best to clarify the text that you have provided, constrain it in the *2700 words* required by NEJM, number of *figures/tables (max5)* and references (*40 ref max*). We edited some of the figures based on comments raised by the discussion on the document and in the LT.  Currently, we are making the last edits and try to shape up the figures.

:bangbang:*We plan on sending a full version of the paper for you to edit and approve tonight (July 15th) ET or early tomorrow morning (July 16th) ET*:bangbang:

*The goal is to submit late this weekend*. Therefore, please include only major edits, motivate clearly your suggestions of changes including the specific wording you would like to use and include the full citation to references that you think are necessary.

As we specified in the GCCR002 authorship agreement (in pdf) you have *36 hours to provide comments*, starting from the posting time.

As of now, please inform the people who do not keep an eye on Slack, complete the authorship agreement if you have contributed and you have not done so already or edit it in light of the contributions you will provide in the next few days. *Complete the <https://forms.gle/b2hFYsXuZHmKpxBb7|google form> to become a GCCR002 author by Friday July 17 6pm ET*.

Major edits, corrections of mistakes are welcome. Long paragraphs will likely not make it into the final version since we are already beyond the allowed word limit.

Constraints:
• 2700 words (currently 2764)
• 5 figures/table in text
• 40 references max
*Track your changes!*
Please do track your changes. Bonus points if your contributions are not labeled anonymous: this will make it really hard for us to figure out who that anonymous among ~N=100 is. :wink:

*References still require contribution*. Please add directly in the GCCR Zotero library (ask <@U010XM0J9Q8> for help). Thanks to <@U010YJ39EMS> for her contributions to the <https://docs.google.com/document/d/10e2VY3fTpkhX3mnXGSFMJY9gxI9j_S5Vi22aEkJqC5w/edit|bibliography digest>: very useful!

*How to suggest comments for figures and captions?*
Figures have been included with the drawing feature in Google docs. Hence, they tend to move around and disappear if the text is heavily edited. You can realize whether figures have disappeared by not finding a box corresponding to a figure indicted in the text (e.g., *Figure 1*). Figures and Tables labels including an ""S"" are included in the supplementary (*Figure S1*).

To better visualize the figures, click on them. The resolution will improve and the caption can be edited. Here, track changes will not work. Please copy the text and include text with your edits in a comment to be placed outside of the drawing feature, in the main text.

Figures are being edited in illustrators. Comments are welcome.

*Code to check*
In python. Last edits late yesterday night. <@U010MTQU5PX> is based on the West Coast. Will share as soon as humanly possible via announcement.

Author list, acknowledgments and COI will be added as soon as available in the shared document.

If you are interested in deploying an online tool in your country that can help track the sense of smell, the sense of taste and chemesthesis, this announcement is for you.

We are seeking people who could work in a team to adapt this tool to their language. For that purpose, 5 or 4 translators, with one of them being the supervisor of the translation, should work on different steps. First, two translators should do the forward translation (English to their language). Once they have finished, two other translators should do the back translation (their language to English). Finally, everyone should discuss about the first and last English versions, for detecting potential discrepancies between both, and then vote for a new translation that minimizes discrepancies. The supervisor will track the progress of the different steps and take part in the final vote. Then, a coordinator assigned to your country will help you with the instructions and will take charge of the communication between you and the implementation team.

Note that you may deploy the self-check tool on your own too, but here we offer the possibility of getting the self-check in your language deployed from a German server. There may be unanticipated technical or feasibility hurdles, so please regard filling out this form as an expression of interest.

If you want to be a part of this procedure, please go to this sheet <https://forms.gle/QfwxZmaHgEm9etp26> and let us know about your country and translation team!

Thank you in advance for your help and interest!

Figure 2. On my first run it through a ‘Tif not supported’ error. From what I remember, installing the pillow package might be an easy fix since matplotlib doesn’t support Tif natively.

Figure 3.
IProgress not found. Simple fix was to update jupyter and ipywidgets, and the error tells you this, so others should be easily able to fix if they run into it.

• TIF export: I believe that <@U013EG4DP19> tracked this down to a version issue in `PIL`, which can be solved (at least for him) by converting one of the pathlib Paths to string before calling `plt.figure`.  
• Language typos: I think this is handled in the cleaning performed in the pre-analysis notebook.  If you look at the list of languages at the bottom of the noteboook, I believe the typos are gone.

it took us a little longer than expected due to the creation of the author list, which is usually more tricky than anticipated.

This is the final version of the paper to be submitted to NEJM. We have carefully read your comments and due to space limits and based on extensive discussions some suggested points have not been included. <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jV0r1xZpFYqC6jauRGMTqvkW-uy_s7k0xG80qZV492M/edit?usp=sharing|Here> you can find a document in which we summarized the main lines of reasoning.

*You have 24 hours  (*deadline July 21st 3PM ET*) to approve the paper in its final form. Please provide approval in this thread.* This will imply that your ICJME contributions will be met.

For MAJOR ISSUES ONLY, please comment in this <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gmCIJ6ergpxv_eyIulT-ZK07R-G5zBOsd-M-mKkjpYw/edit?usp=sharing|google doc>.

With respect to communication, we were hoping not to to let NEJM/JAMA capitalize on communication, though considering the delays, it is best to proceed on our own.

Dear <!channel>,

with GCCR we are unveiling many layers of the submission and publication process that may not be as evident with smaller endeavors. I understand that a lot of information (and some confusion!) come with it, but I hope we can all be on the same page.

As we have previously mentioned we are not allowed by Chemical Senses to post a finalized version of the manuscript in ResarchGate, please refrain from doing so.

Thanks to <@U011BFNUL78>, we have now a corrected the ResearchGate version of GCCR002 (which does not get automatically correctly uploaded from the medRxiv portal). Please claim authorship from that version, do not upload you ones and do not upload public files.

“Claim authorship” by looking under which name you have been listed. In this way, ResearchGate will add the preprint to your profile without affecting the list of authors. If you add yourself under a new name, as an extra author, that would be an issue for the order of authors.

Thank you for your cooperation!",message,

*GCCR002 Re-submission*

Dear <!channel>,

after a lack of a positive response from JAMA, we have resubmitted the paper to Science Translational Medicine (<https://stm.sciencemag.org/>, IF 16).

We chose this journal among others, because of its mission, its reputation and because it allows for flexible authorship criteria as compared to other journals (e.g., PLoS medicine, the JAMA family, ...). The majority of clinical journals require that all 4 ICMJE criteria (listed below) be met by all authors.
• Substantial contributions to conception and design, acquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation of data, and
• Drafting the article or revising it critically for important intellectual content, and
• Final approval of the version to be published, and
• Agreement to be accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are appropriately investigated and resolved.
This would imply that some of the authors in the current author list would not be eligible to be authors. We assumed that this was not your preferred outcome and we proceeded to identify the journal that met all of our previous criteria (medical journal with a broad readership).

We will keep you posted on the outcomes of this submission.

@channel

This timing for the communication of our second preprint has finally come! Thank you all for enthusiasm and patience.

With the goal of maximizing traction to our messages, we preferred not to compete with the well-deserved attention to other high profile papers for the olfactory community in the past few days, while we were hoping that NEJM wanted to capitalize on our original results.

Additionally, journalists would prefer to wait to break the news until the paper has passed peer-review and is accepted for publication (perhaps due to the high-retraction rate of COVID papers).

But now, we seem to have a favorable astral conjunction, so let's tweet out, and let's build attention towards our work!

Below a few tweets that precisely reflect the message in our second paper:

• Self-reported #smell loss is the best predictor of #COVID19. New study from the international collaborative team @GCChemosensoryR #GCCR <https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.22.20157263v2|https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.22.20157263v2>

• Self-reported #smell loss is the best predictor of #COVID19. Based on our findings we developed the ODoR-19 scale a quick, telemedicine-friendly tool to improve #COVID19 screening. New study from the international collaboration @GCChemosensoryR #GCCR <https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.22.20157263v2|https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.22.20157263v2>

• So #smell loss is a predictor of #COVID19. But how good of a predictor and how much smell loss? The best :trophy:! And we propose the ODoR-19 scale :straight_ruler: for quick assessment of self-reported smell loss.  #anosmia <https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.22.20157263v2|https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.22.20157263v2>

We can also use some reformulations of these as well as the image attached, *but key is to keep in mind that while we propose the ODoR-19 scale, it is not validated, so we should be careful with wording.*

Dear <!channel>,

Here are some updates.

*GCCR002*
*Science Advances* - still under review. Hopefully we will receive reviews soon.

*SELF-CHECK UPDATE*
The self-check includes a slightly edited version of the survey questions + the results of the chemosensory ratings following direct experience of household items.

It is currently deployed in *English* and *German*, from which we have ~1700 responses and has just been deployed in *Dutch* as well.

Considering these numbers, the LT believes that there is material for another GCCR paper.
 :spiral_calendar_pad: *What is the plan, then?*

:bar_chart: *FIRST SELF-CHECK DATA TRANCHE*
To be scheduled at the beginning of October. This means that a pre-registration will precede and we hope to have a larger dataset by then.

If you are interested in contributing to the analyses for the preregistration and the paper, contact <@U010KM0A4KG>.

:earth_africa: *TRANSLATIONS*
We currently have in the pipeline 16 translations, of which 5 are in at a relatively good stage and of high priority. Translators, please connect with your translation contact and inform them of when you can complete the translation and back translation process. We aim at deploying the available languages in the next 3 weeks.

• 
• *I have not yet signed up to translate the self-check but I have a team who is interested.* 
&gt; Have you already identified the team who will translate from English to your language?
&gt; Have you already identified the team who will BACK translate from your language to English?
&gt; Who is the dedicated person that will coordinate the translation, the back translation and is in charge of the communication with the GCCR translation team?
Enlist your team <https://forms.gle/QfwxZmaHgEm9etp26|here>.
For this second tranche of deployed languages, your language CAN be considered if:
• you do have access to Google services
• if deployment does *not* require additional ethics clearance. If you have questions about this, address them to <@U010KM0A4KG> our PI of record for this part of the project. 
For other questions about translation procedures please ask one of our fantastic translation coordinators :trophy::

:mega: *COMMUNICATION*
Increasing the number of translations is a way to increase the participants we can reach with the self-check. Another way, is to boost communication about this tool. Please start making a communication plans with your team to reach out to your press office and journalists in your country. We will also prepare some social media messages.

We currently have in the pipeline *8 existing data studies proposals (EDS)* and *3 new data studies proposals (NDS)*. And these are those that have been submitted to the Study Selection Team (SST). The SST coordinates with the Leadership Team (LT) the revision process. usually ~5 short reviews related to programmatic fit and methodological strengths and weaknesses are included in a letter to the project team leader.

• *Wait for a scheduled data tranche* to be released (this will be communicated by LT). In the mean time you may prepare for your data analyses by using an existing data tranche or by creating simulated data. 
• *Perform data analyses.* When your data analysis is done you want to start communicating approximate deadlines to your project team and to the rest of the GCCR membership if this is applicable. You can use the <#C01073JSVLZ|key_announcements> channel for those very essential messages that everyone should know about.

U010JNDUXS9,key_announcements,2020,09,02,2020-09-02,"<@U010KM0A4KG> here's a brief synopsis:
After China, Italy was the first country in which the COVID-19 pandemic rapidly spread. At the release of the  Italian version of the online questionnaire (on April 10th), 98,275 Italians were infected (data provided by the Italian Ministry of Health) This data suggests the possibility that  a high rate of data collected was from subjects in the recovery phase, which could provide  valuable information on the recovery of smell/taste/chemesthesis alterations. In this study we will investigate and characterize smell, taste, and chemesthesis changes AFTER the peak of COVID-19 illness in the Italian residents, and correlate them with different features of the COVID-19 respiratory illness. In particular, we want to:
-       relate the chemosensory abilities and blocked nose recovery (described during the online-survey) with the onset of the respiratory illness 
-       explore whether the degree of recovery of chemosensory abilities depends on the severity of the impairment during the respiratory illness
-       explore whether the results that we will find for the Italian residents can be generalize to other populations

We are currently analyzing the data, and discussing about which expertise we need, but of course everyone willing to help can join the channel! <#C015NTR4VFB|project_recovery>",message,

Dear All,

it is with great pleasure that we announce another GCCR endeavour.
As some of you have expressed interest, both informally and via new data study (NDS) proposals, *we are recontacting back the participants of the survey who left their email address to complete a follow up study*.

This follow up study consists of minor edits a *subset of the GCCR survey questions*, as you can see in the file attached.
We will recontact people who answered the survey from the beginning of the study till August 15th, meaning that they had completed the survey *at least a month* *ago*.

To make the work sustainable but capitalize on the most number of participants, we will refrain from including all languages in the follow up study but *we will focus on the languages which led to the vast majority of emails:* English, French, Italian, Dutch, and Spanish.

Country leaders of these languages please, alert your teams. I will get back to you with a plan on how to handle the translations mid-week.

To test the process, the follow-up survey in English has been deployed today.

Thanks to <@U010HHC57T2>, who is coordinating the effort, and to <@U010MSNP3FH>' team, including <@U010QF09GB0> and <@U011YSJUKM1> for providing invaluable support.

*Abstract:* In the present talk I will briefly review how the GCCR got formed, what is its mission and the current accomplishments as well as vision for the future. I will then focus on the scientific results that we have so far achieved by summarizing the results of our multinational and multi language survey and what we have learned about COVID-19 from the lens of the chemical senses, as well as what we have learned about the chemical senses thanks to COVID-19.
 
*Bio:* Valentina Parma, PhD is a Research Assistant Professor in the Department of Psychology at Temple University, Philadelphia (PA) and the chair of the Global Consortium for Chemosensory Research or <https://uksemiochemistry.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=ffbe8f007fa13d03f0eaf0f54&amp;id=4e1293143a&amp;e=a6945d0383|GCCR>.   As an experimental psychologist, I study the ways in which unconscious cues, such as odors, influence typical and atypical social and motor behavior via behavioral and physiological methods across development. Recently the COVID-19 pandemic has added a new dimension to my research in clinical olfaction. I am also invested in supporting and advising peers and students, advocating for women scientists, promoting open science practices and experimenting with the chemical senses in the kitchen (especially in the patisserie domain).

*UPDATE on GCCR002*

Dear All,

we have received a rejection from _Science Advances_. After careful considerations, we have decided to attempt an appeal and this is the material that we have so far prepared. Some details (e.g., figure in supplementary materials, colored highlights that serve as a trace to check which comments have been addressed, ...) still needs edits, but you will get a good picture of the resubmission.

You can find the rebuttal letter with all comments and the most updated version of the paper attached here. You are welcome to share your comments a<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F0djdgcmy60b7HgczSqjNfY-Q1edswRr4Oo1pRSb840/edit|t this google docs>. If all goes to plan, and you do not find major issues, we'd like to submit tomorrow.

It is quite unlikely that we may be successful with the appeal, but considering the comments and the importance of our findings for the discrimination of individuals with COVID-19 vs. other respiratory illnesses in the upcoming flu season, we ultimately felt compelled to try.

Should the appeal not work, we will submit to a journal that:
• accepts our criteria for authorship (as you may remember, our author list would not qualify based on a common reading of the ICMJE criteria, and we decided not to trim down the list of authors); 
• allows for a fair and quick review, given that our data are timely yet lose novelty quickly in this fast-paced science environment; 
• provide high visibility (we already have 32 citations in the past 3 months at Chemical Senses, suggesting good circulation). 
This shrink our options and leaves only a few. Among those, we suggest that Chemical Senses may still be our best bet. You are welcome to comment and share alternatives that match the points highlighted above <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cHgHBq6zgHGr405-QWDArYLpdpTx-8FNK-vJX3bnC9Q/edit|at this other google docs>.

Dear Dr. Parma,

Thank you for your message. Per our editorial policies, appeals may be considered if authors can provide significant evidence of reviewer error and/or editorial misconduct. It is not clear from your letter that either are the basis for your appeal, and we are therefore unable to process your request. We are sorry your submission did not receive a more positive outcome and hope the comments and feedback from the editors and reviewers will help you in revising and submitting your work to another journal. 

Please feel free to contact me directly if you have any questions.

We kindly ask you to consider checking Slack over the weekend since we believe that re-submitting the paper at the latest on Monday morning will allow us to get the process started before the Thanksgiving holiday in the US (Thursday November 26th). This will maximize our chances to have the paper potentially accepted by the end of 2020.

Looking forward to the next steps with this paper!

Comments to the Author

Review of CS-20-146 by Gerkin et al. submitted to Chemical Senses, entitled ‘Recent smell loss is the best predictor of COVID-19 among individuals with recent respiratory symptoms’.

In this paper, Gerkin et al. explore whether smell loss could be an accurate predictor of COVID-19 status in patients presenting respiratory symptoms. To do so, the authors used the self-reported measures in response to the Global Consortium for Chemosensory Research questionnaire.
As already reported in different studies, the authors show a decrease of chemosensory abilities in Covid 19 + patients compared to Covid 19- patients with respiratory symptoms. The novelty of this specific study lies in the fact that they show that self-reported smell ability occurring along with respiratory symptoms and reported on a continuous scale is the most predictive variable for COVID-19 status (compared to the different answers of the questionnaire). Specifically, a response to the question “rate you current ability to smell on a scale from 0-10” inferior or equal to 2 indicates high odds of COVID-19 positivity. Finally, the authors found that the variable predicting smell-recovery was days since onset of respiratory symptoms.
Given the COVID-19 pandemic and the difficulty for some countries to keep up with the tests, new tools are needed to help for diagnosis. The authors propose here an easy and free measure that when combined to other descriptors of the disease (respiratory symptoms) can be a powerful tool to help for diagnosis or at least to sort out patients/their need to get tested.
While I find this topic obviously of broad interest, I have several concerns relative to this study. In my opinion, there are several key points lacking in the methods. In addition, another analysis can be run to confirm some of their results.
Major comments:
1)   The methods section is too succinct and will need to be more detailed. Below are some of the points that have to appear within the text of the methods:
a.   Please list in the method (study design) the respiratory Symptoms. In addition, in the excluded data: Does “other diagnosis” include points 1 and 5 in response to question 9 of the questionnaire? Can this be detailed in the methods?
b.   How heterogeneous is the Covid-19 Negative group regarding their respiratory symptoms? Please provide details about the distribution and comparison with Covid-19 + group.
c.   It is critical to have a more detailed description of the two groups highlighted in blue in Figure 1. In general Figure 1 is important and the readers need more details about this diagram (participants, inclusion, exclusion…).
2)   Results/ Chemosensory loss associated with COVID-19 and Prediction of COVID-19 status:
Covid-19 Positive with n=4148 vs. Covid-19 Negative n=546. The authors used a simple model of collider bias for their samples (high fraction of Covid-19+ vs. Covid-19- and high prevalence of chemosensory disorders in both groups). In addition to their analysis of Figure S1 and Table S1, can the authors perform a sub sampling of their data (i.e. : pseudo-random selection of 546 Covid-19 positive patients gender and age-matched with Covid-19 – group) for Figure 2 and Figure 3? It would be an additional proof that the results are not biased by the higher fraction of Covid-19+.
3)   Results/ Recovery from smell loss:
As it is, I do not get the point of a variable being a number of days that could predict the probability of recovery from smell loss insomuch as recovery from smell loss was modest. Please elaborate on this in the result part. In the supplementary material, it is specified: “ the only predictive feature of any practical significance was “Days Since Onset” of respiratory symptoms (AUC = 0.62), indicating that those who experienced their first respiratory symptoms less recently are more likely to have Recovered Smell (Figure S6A)”. I believe that this part of the results should be rephrased. The discussion related to this part of the results should also be edited (i.e. “the presence of at least two subgroups of patients: one that recovers quickly (&lt;40 days, 40.9%) and another that may present a more variable time course of recovery (50.7%)”).

Minor comments:
1)   List of the ALL the authors: please clarify the main contributions.
2)   Line 195 : participants (272) ?

Comments to the Author
This is a large-scale survey study focusing on the relationship between olfactory loss and COVID-19 in individuals with recent respiratory symptoms. The authors showed that olfactory loss is strongly associated with COVID-19 status and that recovery from olfactory loss is modest in COVID-19 patients with full or partial resolution of respiratory symptoms. They went on to propose the use of ODoR-19 as a screening method for COVID-19. Overall, the study represents a timely and important contribution to our understandings of the ongoing pandemic.

Major:
1.   Figure 1 shows that 4,655 participants were excluded for reasons other than “no respiratory illness” and “incomplete ratings”. That is 30% of the size of the final sample. The authors should provide more justifications regarding why they are excluded. For instance, why exclude participants (n = 2,835) for “no onset date provided” (Q7 in Appendix I asks about onset date yet states that “leave blank if you do not remember”)? Whether onset date was provided should not affect the analysis of the relationship between olfactory loss and COVID-19 status. Why exclude participants (n = 1,650) for “other diagnosis”? What were those “other diagnosis”? 
2.   “Changes in taste ability” and “sore throat” were predictive symptoms for COVID-19 (l.281-285). Why were they not included in the multivariate model shown in Figure 3C?
3.   Whereas it is quite intuitive that “days since onset of respiratory symptoms” (DOS) predicated the probability of recovery (l.342-344), it is difficult to understand why DOS was predicative for COVID-19 status (Figure 3D shows that DOS was more predictive than “fever+cough+dyspnea”) and adding DOS to “smell during illness” produced the largest incremental gain in predictive performance for COVID-19 status (line 291-293). Please explain.



Minor
4.   Q8 in Appendix I asks about COVID-19 status and has 8 choices. It would be helpful to include in the main text (rather than in SI) a breakdown of the answers to this question and to state explicitly which (with N numbers) were included in the prediction of COVID-19 status from survey responses. 
5.   C19- participants appeared to be older than C19+ participants. Could age account for the differences in their baseline ratings described in l.260-265? Also, what were the directions of the differences?
6.   Information about smoking behavior was collected (Q34, Q35) but not described in the main text. Was it comparable between C19+ and C19- individuals?
7.   L.412-414: delete redundant “in distinguishing between COVID-19 and other other respiratory illnesses” and “as seen with,”.",message,

Dear All, 

The preregistration for *GCCR003* – our follow-up survey focused on recovery – has been submitted to OSF and should go live between today and tomorrow. Contributions to this paper will occur in two separate phases: data analysis first , followed by manuscript writing.

The GCCR003 project leads – <@U010HHC57T2> and <@U010MSNP3FH> – are inviting all members who want to contribute to data analysis for this paper to join the newly created *#GCCR003_data_analysis* channel to coordinate analysis efforts.

There, you will find there a link to the pre-registered analysis plan. Exploratory analyses are certainly welcome, but the primary focus will be on the pre-registered analyses. Individual who have the skills (*or would like to learn the skills*) to perform specified analyses, and would like to *work within the broader analysis team*, are welcome to sign up for a specific chunk of analysis.

The formal *Authorship agreement* for the GCCR003 paper is currently under development. Given what we have learned from trying to publish GCCR001 and GCCR002, it *will be substantially revised* from prior efforts. Specifically, we will be adhering to ICMJE criteria for authorship, as many journals strictly enforce these criteria, and we want to have the opportunity to publish in the widest possible range of journals.
 
Briefly, the four ICMJE criteria required for authorship are:
*Substantial contributions to conception and design, acquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation of data, AND
*Drafting the article or revising it critically for important intellectual content, AND
*Final approval of the version to be published, AND
*Agreement to be accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are appropriately investigated and resolved.

*To get things rolling*, the GCCR003 project leads are focused on working collaboratively on data analyses so that we can outline the results. Once initial results are available, a shared working outline will be provided to facilitate writing the manuscript. We will keep you updated with messages on the key announcements. 

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to <@U010HHC57T2>, <@U010MSNP3FH> or GCCR chair <@U010GME5DU4>",message,

Hi :wave: I'm Maria. I love eggs, because they are miraculous :egg:. The first superfood basically and then all that amazing chemistry and flavor. There is nothing better. I joined this channel because besides liking food, I like getting others interested in food.

For the newsletter I want to specifically reflect on how the :gccr: is growing and expanding. I would like to explain a bit of our long terms vision and how consortium research is changing science  in a very necessary way. So I would like to write something about that, but besides that I love science communication:left_speech_bubble: and graphics and know how to do layout in software like Indesign, but that skill is probably not so useful here. I also know Illustrator very well :nerd_face:.

I think this newsletter will be very important for inclusion, because Slack is hard for many people, so hopefully this will draw more of our members to Slack. :gccr: -&gt; :newspaper: -&gt; :slack: This means I think that the newsletter may turn out to be key to continued success of the consortium, so I hope you can help us make this newsletter great. :trophy:

&gt; Our olfactory research team founded by joint effort of otorhinolaryngology, radiology and neurology tries to tackle different aspects of olfactory dysfunction using advanced neuroimaging tools in order to better understand the pathogenesis, correlate with clinical findings and predict prognosis. Our latest publication in European Journal of Radiology on olfactory nerve and bulb imaging is a reflection of this effort. In the paper “A new perspective on imaging of olfactory dysfunction: Does size matter?”, we tried to show that olfactory bulb imaging can be expanded beyond volumetric analysis, which has been the main approach so far. We demonstrated that morphology and signal intensity of olfactory bulb can be used to discriminate between different etiologies of olfactory dysfunction and achieve better accuracy than volumetric analysis. Additionally, our findings suggest that olfactory nerve filia distribution pattern can also be used for the same purpose.
&gt; We are hoping to expand our research efforts on olfactory bulb imaging to a larger number of cases and different settings like olfaction recovery, with the ultimate aim of expanding the clinical realm of olfactory bulb imaging.

What is interesting to note is that c19 patients are reporting a slightly different scenario than typical pv patients. In the typical pattern, you might expect to see total loss, followed by inklings of disorganised smell messages, turning into parosmia for a period of several months, with eventual resolution as recovery progresses. In the C19 group, there is absolute smell loss followed by sometimes rapid recovery to “normal” (not distorted) smell. Then after a period of days, parosmia develops.

I assume that Pre-COVID-19 anosmia people asked way later, so it could be that these people had to go through the regeneration process and rewiring process. However, in the COVID-19 anosmia people, I am thinking it could be the strong inflammation causing the sudden anosmia and the recovery to normal sense after the inflammation is suppressed/decreased. I think it is necessary to consider there are multiple ways that the anosmia is happening; inflammation and necrosis by invasion of virus, and in the latter case it takes longer term and requires rewiring.",message,

Now, almost half of the complains from COVID-19 patients are focused on parosmia, often after a longer period of anosmia. We are following our patients and it seems there are many with a prolonged smell loss after COVID-19 (28% without any improvement after a month, n=100). Some of patients with prolonged smell loss are now complaining of parosmia - some after a short (almost full) recovery of the sense of smell. It would be nice to include data collection on the temporal dynamics of parosmia in the home test data, so these patterns can be compared with the long term outcome after olfactory training.",message,

We have many report from our patients that at the begining of the disease process,they experienced severe headache,unresponsive to any medication. So I think that one of the possible mechanism for smell disorder with COVID-19 is central causes/ encephalitis. We don’t know,maybe this outbreak of <#C014KBD90PQ|parosmia> following anosmia/ hyposmia, is related to the central malfunction of the olfactory center not just due to inflammation around the receptors. I don’t know........",message,thread_broadcast
U010UTDM4HE,parosmia,2020,06,24,2020-06-24,"<@U013CR6C15H> I am actually not thinking inflammation only at the OE. There are many patients in the Facebook group reporting symptoms of encephalitis and I have been telling them in that way. So, yes, inflammation in the brain as a mechanism, which means that the signaling is okay but it is not recognized, is possible. Also, a recent paper using MRI showed inflammation in the olfactory bulb, suggesting that the transmission of the signaling at the OB is not working. In that paper, the same patient showed recovery from the inflammation in the 28 days post recovery (need to confirm the days) image. I have the impression of ""inflammation everywhere"", and depending on the patient, where the main (strongest) location of inflammation is could be different and the level of damage also. I also think of secondary infections in some patients... Although the symptom as anosmia is common to the patients, it is I think necessary to think case by case (maybe of course)...",message,
U010H1EC3J8,parosmia,2020,06,24,2020-06-24,<@U010UTDM4HE> can you tie this mechanism in any way to reports of parosmia onset *after* recovery has happened or is underway? This is something that I don’t understand.,message,
U010UTDM4HE,parosmia,2020,06,24,2020-06-24,"<@U010H1EC3J8> So this is all ""what if"" and ""maybe"" at this stage but, Jane's hypothesis she mentioned yesterday was interesting and I was thinking after I heard her talk. If I remember correctly, she said there are certain chemical compounds common to the smell that patients report. It made me wonder if there are differences in the re-expression of the olfactory receptors. I used ""re-expression"" to separate from the regeneration of olfactory neurons. Smell of for example lavender is comprised of over 500 different chemical compounds. The delicate smell of lavender as a whole will become distorted if only part of the olfactory receptors necessary to smell it are re-expressed. That is what I thought from Jane's hypothesis. So I wondered if there are certain area in the olfactory membrane that become more damaged or higher in inflammation. We know that there is zone structure in the OE. If there is an area that is more damaged or higher in inflammation that it takes longer time to regenerate, that could be the reason of the distorted smell, this is 'tons of maybes'. If patients are experiencing rather similar parosmia, it will support this hypothesis, again just ""what if"" ""maybe"" ""can it be?"" for now. And this is all based on focusing on OE and not OB and cortex.",message,

*ENT UK statement on the failure to recognise lost sense of smell or taste as symptoms of COVID-19 infection*

It is nearly eight weeks since ENTUK and the BRS issued a pressrelease alerting physiciansglobally to the risk that patients presenting with isolated anosmia may be suffering with COVID-19 infection. We advised that patients with new-onset anosmia should be advised to self-isolate in order to reduce the risk of transmission by otherwise asymptomatic carriers of infection.At the time of writing the original press release, evidence was largely anecdotal. Since then physicians and researchers have produced overwhelming evidence through international collaboration to show that loss of sense of smell (with or without loss of taste) is one of the most prevalent symptoms of COVID-19, and that it is also a highly specific marker, better than both cough or fever in this respect. It is now recognised by the World Health Organisation and the Centre for Disease Control in the United States. ...""",message,

Abstract:
Altered olfactory function is a common symptom of COVID-19, but its etiology is unknown. A key question is whether SARS-CoV-2 (CoV-2) – the causal agent in COVID-19 – affects olfaction directly, by infecting olfactory sensory neurons or their targets in the olfactory bulb, or indirectly, through perturbation of supporting cells. Here we identify cell types in the olfactory epithelium and olfactory bulb that express SARS-CoV-2 cell entry molecules. Bulk sequencing demonstrated that mouse, non-human primate and human olfactory mucosa expresses two key genes involved in CoV-2 entry, ACE2 and TMPRSS2. However, single cell sequencing revealed that ACE2 is expressed in support cells, stem cells, and perivascular cells, rather than in neurons. Immunostaining confirmed these results and revealed pervasive expression of ACE2 protein in dorsally-located olfactory epithelial sustentacular cells and olfactory bulb pericytes in the mouse. These findings suggest that CoV-2 infection of non-neuronal cell types leads to anosmia and related disturbances in odor perception in COVID-19 patients.<https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/07/24/sciadv.abc5801.1>",message,

I have a hypothesis that the anosmia is caused by 2 major reasons, one is of course by the virus invasion to olfactory epithelium and the other is because of the increase existing bacteria and fungus caused by immunosuppression by COVID-19, and common to both is the inflammation. I am thinking of a new project to determine the possible role of bacteria and fungus from the symptoms along time course.",message,
U010UTDM4HE,projectideas,2020,05,11,2020-05-11,"Another idea I have is related to treating (but not with medicine). Unless patients become hard to breathe, patients are staying at home. As the anosmia is caused by COVID-19, it is important to recover from COVID-19 as quickly as possible before severe damage to the OE. The best thing they can do is to ""go back to home remedies"": foods and drinks and supplements that have anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-viral, and anti-microbial effects (the last is based on my bacteria hypothesis). I am trying to summarize what foods and drinks and supplements have these effects.

That is, is COVID19 changing eating habits because a) lockdown/disrupted food supply, b) stress altering food choices (i.e., more high ED comfort foods), c) economics (i.e., more self stable staples/less F&amp;V), or d) altered chemosensation?

Seems to me that that first 3 factors are just as critical as the last, and if we only study the last, we'll miss the big picture. That said, I strongly suspect other research teams are already doing a, b, c, so we don't want to be also rans.

SST will ask teams with similar proposals to consider uniting forces.,message,channel_purpose
U010KDF9AVD,projectideas,2020,05,16,2020-05-16,"Part of the GCCR mission is to encourage and facilitate global collaboration in concert with local collaboration across countries, labs, scientists and clinicians interested in the chemical senses.

 Post your project idea in this channel. Or find a project idea that you can contribute to. Feel free to start your own project channel as soon as your discussions no longer fit into a single thread.

 Projects can be based on already collected data or can be a study that will collect new data. Use *<https://gccr-mql6351.slack.com/files/U010GME5DU4/F013CRJEVB4/gccr-_study_proposal_and_selection.pdf|this pdf form>* to submit a study proposal and send it to <@U010GME5DU4>. The Study Selection Team (SST) will then get blind reviews of the proposal and will assign a priority score. 

We ask that teams with similar proposals consider joining forces, which can be facilitated by discussing project ideas in Slack. SST may also ask similar proposals to merge.

We encourage you to think out of the box, for example, patients can initiate a study on ENTs' general knowledge of the chemical senses.

*Chronological checklist new projects:* 
:ballot_box_with_check: *Find a project idea* (if you don’t have one, go to channel <#C01364E7WBY|projectideas> to find newly hatched ideas or check the Slackmap <https://gccr-mql6351.slack.com/archives/C013BD495MM/p1589617084015900|here> to find project ideas that have matured enough to have their own channel

:ballot_box_with_check: *Find team mates* (find them on <#C01364E7WBY|projectideas> or the <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1boluXQ6QyWfAK6jMFHOlmfPfru9qD81N8mt6H5PLKoE/edit?usp=sharing|membership skills database>:, or bring in new GCCR members from outside)

:ballot_box_with_check: *Start a channel* (and notify <@U010KDF9AVD> if you want your project channel to be listed in the Slack map)

:ballot_box_with_check: *Prepare a project proposal* with <https://gccr-mql6351.slack.com/files/U010GME5DU4/F013CRJEVB4/gccr-_study_proposal_and_selection.pdf?origin_team=T010GME5DSQ&amp;origin_channel=C01364E7WBY|this guide> and <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1faPF4qdDpDYvhUgh5IRZr8yaHVapBKog/view?usp=sharing|this proposal form>. Probably your most helpful resource to figuring out some of the details are to refer to the existing GCCR preregistrations. For examples of preregistrations check out the channel <#C013BMW9N5V|example_project_materials> where we keep a collection of links

:ballot_box_with_check: *Submit project proposal* to <@U010GME5DU4> or someone else on the leadership team (LT), they will take our team names and pass the proposal on the study selection team (SST), who will send it out to reviewers. Currently the timelines have been pretty short for this, around a week, but this may take longer depending on how easy it is to find reviewers. <@U010SGDUGN4> is your contact point on the SST.

:ballot_box_with_check: *Revise and resubmit* if requested by the SST and agreed upon by the project team

:ballot_box_with_check: *Write authorship agreement* and ask for approval from LT for the agreement. For examples of authorship agreements check out the channel <#C013BMW9N5V|example_project_materials>

:ballot_box_with_check: *Post authorship agreement* to membership in #key_anouncements channel. This is also a good time to introduce your project a little bit and ask for specific contributions if you need them.

:ballot_box_with_check: *Create a preregistration* on <http://osf.io|osf.io>. For examples of preregistrations check out the channel <#C013BMW9N5V|example_project_materials> where we keep a collection of links. Notify the LT of your pregistration.

:ballot_box_with_check: *Wait for a scheduled data tranche* to be released (this will be communicated by LT). In the mean time you may prepare for your data analyses by using an existing data tranche or by creating simulated data.

:ballot_box_with_check: *Perform data analyses.* 

:ballot_box_with_check:  *Communicate deadlines* When your data analysis is done you want to start communicating approximate deadlines to your project team and to the rest of the GCCR membership if this is applicable. You can use the <#C01073JSVLZ|key_announcements> channel for those very essential messages that everyone should know about. We can also include something in an email message that goes out to all members (we do this very rarely only) and your project team can also present something or ask for contributions in a town hall meeting

:ballot_box_with_check: *Create a form for authorship sign-up* (if applicable). For examples of authorship sign-up forms, check out the channel <#C013BMW9N5V|example_project_materials> where we keep a collection of links

When you find time, maybe revisit the docs to see where we’re at, and feel free to share any ideas you  might have on the best path forward.

The draft needs a little bit of ""tidying"" but for the most part, the key points are there. Seems like to get some forward moving momentum, it could be submitted to the SST. Now that there are TWO SSTs, hopefully they will have time to give feedback on the proposal and help tweak things based on the other 8+ proposals that have been submitted.

U010JNDUXS9,project_recovery,2020,07,10,2020-07-10,"<!channel> Con <@U010LJGGGGH> abbiamo fatto un'analisi preliminare dei dati dei residenti in Italia riguardante il recupero delle abilità chemosensoriali. Le analisi le abbiamo fatte seguendo le ipotesi che avevamo pre-registrato. L'ipotesi iniziale era che l'Italia doveva avere un m maggior numero di ""guariti"" dato l'onset precoce....ovviamente non è così (prima ipotesi smentita), poi avevamo ipotizzato che un fattore che influenzasse il rating ""after"" doveva ancora una volta essere il numero di giorni passati tra l'onset e la compilazione del questionario ma anche in questo caso abbiamo cantato. In realtà queste ipotesi risultano vere per la Francia...

Vi allego il link al file con i modelli applicati e alcune figure estremamente preliminari quindi si accettano suggerimenti sostanziali sulle figure da includere, eliminare e/o aggiungere.

Proviamo a fare come si fa nel canale principale, abbiamo tracciato un outline, riportato le ipotesi pre-registatae e i risultati delle analisi. Chi vuole contribuire scriva il proprio nome in relazione alla parte scritta.
Diciamo che il file rimane accessibile a questo link sino a Lunedì sera:

<@U010V9B9K5H> Carla da 234 - 466
Federica 467-703

U010JNDUXS9,project_recovery,2020,12,02,2020-12-02,"Dear <!channel>, a new version of the manuscript will be soon available for comments, in the meantime, we thought that it would be helpful to discuss about the journal that could be target for our publication.
Here, some points that I think should be taken into account:
1. In our paper we model the recovery of the different chemosensory abilities and not many papers are out there that describe it. Therefore, it is a fairly new topic
2. We used an analytical approach that started from general model with both fixed and random effect and applied stepwise model selection to select the simplest model that could fit our data. This was possible also thanks to the several variables that were included in the GCCR questionnaire. This approach to my knowledge has not been used yet (for the recovery at least). 
3. We also unravel some interesting links between age and recovery, smoking habits and recovery and regional differences. Especially the latter strengthen the idea that GCCR questionnaire could be used to monitor  the COVID-19 pandemic. 
4. Although we used only the ""Italian part of the dataset"", I think Italy still remains the most interesting country worth to investigate because its status of first European country to deal with the Pandemic and the first then to deal with some degree of recovery. 
These are my takes on the work, which of course are biased and for these reasons I asked you to think about and identify the right journal. And just to be more explicit I think we could try a journal with moderate-high impact. Please comments, thanks!",message,

That means we need a power analysis. We can look at what's already published on COVID-19 or refer to other virus-anosmia papers. Please reply with link to paper that we could use for this and for those of you that know the appropriate type of power analysis for this situation, please spell out what information from those papers we need. We can use apps to get averages, standard deviations and effect sizes from figures even if they are not in text or tables.
Step 1. List papers. Indicate virus. Indicate comparison (patients vs healthy or virus A vs virus B patients). Indicate if we can get extract data from the paper for power analysis and if so how. Indicate outcome variable and scale (anosmia y/n or Sniffin' Sticks TDI).
Step 2.  Extract the relevant data.
Step 3. Run a power analysis for an independent samples t-test.
Justification: I think that our primary test will be an independent samples t-test comparing ""smell during illness"" VAS rating  for COVID-19 + people to others (COVID-19 - or FLU +). This may also be ""smell during illness"" VAS rating _minus_ ""smell before illness"" VAS rating. Please comment.
Here are two important questions for finding the papers for Step 1:
• Are there any papers on self-report ratings of smell function and viral infections? <@U010616MZ99> <@U0107D4SH25> <@U010HK2RMEU> <@U010XM0J9Q8> <@U0110MDV1N3> Or was this always investigated with objective tests like UPSIT or Sniffin' Sticks. If so, is it a stretch to use objective tests to determine effect size for self-report outcome?
• Do we want to look at effect sizes from papers for healthy vs virus patients or would that effect size be too large for what we are looking for? I think we want to be conservative and assume a small effect size, because we have to ask the question, is COVID-19 associated with MORE anosmia than other respiratory viral illnesses?

I really like Bob’s paper for this situation because this is not a self-selected group (<@U010XM0J9Q8> right?), but it is common to see olfactory changes during a common cold so it is a good example for effect size during an acute viral infection. So he saw a decrease of ~10 points (+/- 5 points) on the TDI for a common cold (relative to post recovery or healthy) with an average of ~29 point, which is just below normosmia (formally in the hyposmic range) on a total range of possible scores between 1 and 48 points.

Cohen's _d_ = (28.84 - 33.85) ⁄ 4.676291 = 1.071362.
Glass's _delta_ = (28.84 - 33.85) ⁄ 4.27 = 1.173302.

U010SS42QQ3,questionnaire-data-analysis,2020,04,03,2020-04-03,"Another comment, if we do not deem the countries as a random factor, there is no need to compel each country to gather the sample size computed for each group. In theory, the sample size computed from the power analysis shall be the total one (so each country can contribute with its own part). However, if we hypothesize that, for some reason, each country can indeed have its own effect, then we shall compute a power analysis for a multilevel model. It can be done through simulation in R, but the we would need another parameter (two, actually) to plug-in the simulation: an hypothesized variance in the intercept and the hypothesized variance in the slope. This might be very tricky, indeed, and perhaps a pilot study might be required just to estimate these parameters. Another source might be a tau squared from a meta-analysis on the difference between cold vs healthy participants in self-reported smell function assessment.",message,
U010KDF9AVD,questionnaire-data-analysis,2020,04,03,2020-04-03,"We don’t know about the country effect, so not sure what to so for that. So when doing the power analysis with just the group means the recommended sample size is really small, like 16 or something (b/c that paper, a good lab study, actually has a pretty good effect size). We will not have that much control and we know there will be a lot more noise or bias. Thats why I ended up doing it with lowest and highest values of the confidence intervals of the groups (closest values, so UL for the cold group, LL for the control group, so more conservative). That suggested sample size of 119. How about we have a 2 phase plan for determining final sample size. We collect 119 participants in the covid+ and flu+ groups and use that as pilot data for whichever country reaches that first? (Or across countries) And once we have that pilot data we can do more complex power analysis like you suggest above. Or would we need pilot data from multiple countries to estimate variance from countries?",message,
U010SS42QQ3,questionnaire-data-analysis,2020,04,03,2020-04-03,"Perhaps, we can try with estimating the confidence intervals for the effect size first. I can compute them in R, I just need the t-value for the comparison between the cold group and the control group along the sample sizes for the two groups. We then may compute the power for the LL of the Cohen’s D.
The two phases option seems also quite compelling, but at that point we shall probably need a big enough sample from each country, so that we can estimate the intercept and slope variance of the effect.
Another approach could be do to define a minimal effect of interest, and build the power analysis upon that. Is there a difference in the original scale of the sel-report that we deem as clinically significant? if so, we may define the sample size on that, using the standard deviation in each group to compute the pooled standard deviation.",message,thread_broadcast

U010KDF9AVD,questionnaire-data-analysis,2020,04,04,2020-04-04,"Comments from  <@U010GME5DU4>: Alongside this, I think that the Bayesian approach would be particularly useful to our purposes. Here are two reasons why:
-       The Bayes factor (BF) quantifies the relative evidence in the data, with respect to whether data is better predicted by the null hypothesis or the alternative. This will allow us to interpret the null, if we find ourselves in that situation.
 
-       Following a sequential Bayes factor design (SBFD) we can optionally increase the sample size, and not commit to a given sample size from the beginning a new BF is calculated and the stopping rule is determined by reaching a predefined threshold of evidential strength (see image).


 
 
The rationale of the SBFD is the following:
1.    Define a priori the evidence threshold for H1 and H0 that we expect to reach (per country): e.g., data indicate that outcome is 10 times more likely under H1 than H0 and data indicate that outcome is 6 times more likely under H0 than H1. Note that the thresholds for the null or the alternative can be different. 
2.    Choose a prior distribution for effect sizes under H1. Like in this case, when we can only approximate the estimation of an effect size, we can run a pilot with the first 20 participants, and change the prior based on that. Also, we can run the analyses under multiple priors and report the results (easily done via JASP, but also R).
3.    We recompute the BF at any stage we want, it is part of the analysis strategy.
4.    Reaching the evidence threshold will determine when we can think about publication, and perhaps allow for a quick report that is reliable. Then, we can still publish the whole dataset from all respondents in a parametric way + Bayesian to maximise the understanding.

U010KDF9AVD,questionnaire-data-analysis,2020,04,06,2020-04-06,"Here are the comments from Yuval Benjamini, a colleague of <@U010HHC57T2>, who is experienced with the type of data we'll be using. Over the next day or two I would like to try to compile a data analysis plan based on this and the other inputs we have had so far. Would anyone be interested in writing an initial draft of this section?
&gt; In my opinion, it would be better to work with a normalised variable as the primary outcome. 
&gt; This would mean to compare the difference between “Before the Disease” and “During the Disease” sense of smell, instead of the raw “During the Disease variable”. 
&gt; This measure can still be used to compare across diseases. 
&gt; 
&gt; In any case, this difference as well as sample sizes can be determined by a small pilot study which I strongly recommend doing. 
&gt; 
&gt; This would take, say 100 qs, and use these to calibrate, decide on normalisation strategies, choose variables, set samples sizes and how to handle multi-sites, and pre-register. 
&gt; 
&gt; Regarding Bayes, Sequential, etc.
&gt; 
&gt; I think that this is a classical hypothesis testing framework, and if you’re pooling individuals from many countries T-test is great + confidence interval. 
&gt; I don’t think the Bayes-Factors has real advantages in this case (but I am not really a Bayesian). 
&gt; 
&gt; Regarding sequential design, that is also fine (and can be done frequentist with t-test like designs or Bayesian). 
&gt; One thing you should consider is that you will need to decide on the sequence. 
&gt; For example, all Qs filled by the end of the day will be entered together. 
&gt; In my opinion, since potential population is huge and the interest of the different groups are to sample from many countries, 
&gt; early stopping is not the best strategy. Better to use pilot data and sample size calculation to make sure that we can identify meaningful differences with very high probability. 
&gt; 
&gt; If we are interested in computing effect sizes per country or population, then Bayesian methods (or random effect models) have merit and should be considered. 
&gt; They will estimate the likely effect in each population. 
&gt; I think these analyses will augment nicely the global pooled t-test.",message,

Small samples produce unstable estimates that cannot be trusted (e.g., see <https://research.tue.nl/en/publications/when-power-analyses-based-on-pilot-data-are-biased-inaccurate-eff>).
One advantage of a Bayesian approach is that it can also be estimated the relative evidence for the null vs the alternative, although with a high powered study a frequentist equivalence test can be used as well.",message,

IN the GCCR001_041920 project, you will find a file with INSTRUCTIONS that provides information on how to contribute so that we can have a quick improvement of preliminary results for tomorrow.

Although we are not changing the scope of the analysis, you can *improve the analysis* (providing robustness checks, more elegant code or alternatives in line with the pre-registration at <https://osf.io/auhs8/> and posted in the daily summary yesterday) and the *graphics*.

We ask three independent contributors to check the code for accuracy and test it for possible misunderstanding and to ensure reliability. If you want to be one of them, make sure to submit your comments and alert <@U010GME5DU4> here.

Correlation matrices for the two groups with reported diagnosis during a clinical exam (left, n = 2540) and lab test (right, n = 1317). We established a moderate correlation between smell change and taste change (r = 0.46/0.41 respectively) and a weak correlation between smell change and chemesthesis change (r = 0.29/0.25). Further, the change in smell perception with regards to the onset of the disease is related to a reduced sense of smell (r = -0.56/-0.46). Also, the worse the reduction of smell perception, the more fluctuations in smell perception (r = -0.23/-0.27) and the more taste changes (r = -0.28/- 0.23) are evident. Most importantly, the changes in all three chemosensory modalities are not related to the nasal occlusion change in either group.

To further characterize the relationship between changes in nasal occlusion and reports of changes in the three chemosensory modalities we computed a Principal Component Analysis during vs. before the illness. The results are visualized in a correlation circle. Changes (during minus before) in smell, taste, and chemesthesis ratings correlated strongly with component 1 (smell: r = XXX; taste: r = XXX; chemesthesis: r = XXX), which explained 45.2 % of the total multidimensional variance (inertia). In contrast, change in nasal occlusion correlated strongly (r = xxxxx) with the orthogonal component 2, which explains 24.6 % of the total inertia. The results indicate statistical independence of changes in chemosensory ability and nasal occlusion. In other words, smell reduction cannot be explained by nasal occlusion.

Also a brief explanation for the method section of what the contrib variable is and how to read the color coding in the PCA graph would be great! Thaks!",message,

Specifically:
• within each modality, we'd like to have the graphs in this order: geom_point, geom_boxplot, geom_flat_violin for the before rating and geom_flat_violin, geom_boxplot, geom_point for the during rating (during mirrors before). This will prevent the geom_line to crossover the during dot and boxplot.
• can you make the lab test group the darker colored group? It will help with visibility of the layers
• Can you change the color as follows: Smell = orange; Taste = blue; Chemesthesis = red/magenta; Nasal occlusion = green. 
• Can you make sure that the lightest color is still in relative high contrast with the background? The light blue of the current smell for instance is harder to see.

But what was the criteria of units of change between before and during if they report ""no"" change in sense of smell?",message,
U010GME5DU4,questionnaire-data-analysis,2020,04,26,2020-04-26,"Sorry for my late reply on this, many things on my plate.

I definitely believe we should acknowledge that the sample is unbalanced and that at the moment we do not have the power for an analysis by country, even if we limit the number of countries that we include.

The bias I can think of are two: one is *response bias* - who is more likely to respond to the survey.  This is always going to be a convenience sample with people answering out of personal interest, or availability (communication in France has been great, which one may argue makes the sample less  unrepresentative?).

The second bias is a *cultural bias* - do we expect that the chemosensory symptoms are different by country? Although to limit this possibility we need to control for country, we need a powered analysis to do so.

So, I run some of the Bayesian models with country as fixed factors and the results do not change. I have not thoroughly run all of them but it seems to me that acknowledging that i) our sample is unbalanced by country, ii) that we do not have the power right now to look at those country differences and iii) that we will learn from this database to pre-register later studies should seem to be enough.

Accordingly, I'd love to see GCCR002 focus on covid versus flu/colds and GCCR003 focus on country and rural versus urban. We aren't lacking for data!

Dear all,

help needed with reproducible figures/tables.
*Caveat*: they need to be fully reproducible in R.

Edits needed:
- *the raincloud plots look a little squeezed.* <@U011LB61P36> can you please add some space in between the dotplot, boxplot and the density plot? Thank you. If you are busy and have a quick code snippet to share, I can try to incorporate.

- *overall the font of the figures could be larger:* Can somebody edit figure 3,4,5,6 for this?

- *the labels in the biplot should not overlay with the vectors (+ need to be larger):* Figure 5, can somebody take a glace?

- *the 3x3 correlation matrix in the Figure 6 should probably be square*: <@U010SGDUGN4> sorry this is being a nightmare :slightly_smiling_face: Can you create the figure with the three chemosensory modalities only? I used your code, but this is the final result. Please see this script and dataset, thanks!

- *tables:* <@U010JNDUXS9> your suggestion of using htmlTable was great. Yet, it does not knit in R Markdown in pdf or word. I'm trying to see if we can include these as tables directly, and pander is  package that knits with R Markdown. Though the multiple merged cells do not appear. Can you take a look? Thank you!

If you could send this within the day, it would be great!
Best,

V

Also left align panel A within the wrapper. It looks right aligned and part of the legend is disappearing under the B part.

U010HK2RMEU,random,2020,05,11,2020-05-11,"Hi all. I just received this email, by a Swiss hospital. No idea why they contacted me specifically, or what (if anything) I should recommend to them? Anyone happy to take over this contact and respond to them?

"" Dear Prof. Boesveldt,
 
We at the University clinic of Bern, Swiss plan to track COVID-19 patients with wearable biosensors in order to obtain a good picture of the progression of disease from early onset.
In order to screen for COOVID-patients before the test result is obtained we would like to use a quick and cheap smell test. We believe that this may give us a 50:50 chance to include COVID-19 patients in our studies just when they arrive at the COVID-Track of the Inselspital.
Therefore my question to you: What sniff test would you suggest for our study? Are there some cheap reliable odors that we might use or would you suggest using a more costly commercially available test kit like the B-SIT test?
 
Best,""",message,

U0131LXH1C6,random,2020,05,15,2020-05-15,"There are standard tests used in the evaluation of anosmia.  My version of Harrison's says the following: ""the degree to which qualitative sensations are present can be assessed by any of several methods. The Odor Stix test uses a commercially available odor-producing marker-like pen held approximately 8 to 15 cm (3 to 6 inches) from the patient's nose to check for gross perception of the odorant.  Another gross perception of odorant test, the 30-cm alcohol test, uses a freshly opened isopropyl alcohol packet held approximately 30 cm (12 inches) from the patient's nose.  There is a commercially available scratch-and-sniff card containing three odors available for testing olfaction grossly.  A superior test is the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT). This consists of a 40-item, forced choice, microencapsulated odor, scratch-and-sniff-paradigm.  For example, one of the items reads, 'this odor smells most like (a) chocolate, (b) banana, (c) onion, or (d) fruit punch,' and the patient is instructed to answer one of the alternatives. The test is highly reliable, is sensitive to age and sex differences, and provides an accurate quantitative determination of the olfactory deficit. Persons with a total loss of smell function score in the range of 7 to 19 out of 40. The average score for total anosmics is slightly higher than that expected on the basis of chance because of the inclusion of some odorants that act by trigeminal stimulation.""",message,

Even in profession in labs or in factories you see regularly contamination that people don’t even notice till you point out. so with non-noses, i can’t even imagine. you think is obvious, nope.  and if you want to check whether something is still good, you have to find a qualified nose. or when one bottle is finished, they want to buy that one bottle but not the others. when they close the bottle already it goes all over the collar of the bottle. just saying be ready for liquids for large audience, even if chemistry literate (dr’s/psychologists), with public even worse.",message,

I kept getting told that the machine was broken or they must have the wrong cuff, or maybe I’m really anxious.

Second, the self-report and questionnaire-based evaluation could not clearly discriminate the symptoms of loss of smell and taste in patients with COVID-19.

One is a randomized controlled trial using budesonide (topical steroid) in a high volume saline irrigation.

U010UTDM4HE,random,2020,09,28,2020-09-28,"Dear <@U010HHC57T2>, I think it is a very interesting and important paper. As it is already over half a year since the pandemic started and there are many patients suffering for months, these follow up studies are precious. And the results are very interesting. I have been analyzing the free reports of patients myself on internet website for a patient group, so it was interesting to compare with my results as well. The onset of the loss of smell and taste is totally similar, 4 days after the onset of other symptoms on average.  This makes me wonder whether it is possible to prevent losing the sense if the patients could start treating early (this may not be a comment to the paper but thoughts in general. It seems important to enhance awareness of the variety of the symptoms). The results on the severity of COVID-19 (taking longer time to recover and went until 3rd interview) and recovery rate of the sense (the longer it takes, the recovery of the sense is not good) is very understandable.  One question I had is whether you also had a question at the interview that let the patients freely report the symptoms (like ""any other symptoms?""). It will enable finding symptoms that are under-recognized so far. I see reports on dry nose/mouth often in the free reports on the patients support group website. As ACE2 is expressed on secretary cells in the nose/mouth, I am thinking this could be one of the typical symptom to COVID-19 but under-recognized. If you did not have free report question, it might open some new paths in the analyses if you add it in future?",message,

I am wondering what happens if the virus occupies the sialic acid receptors... Sialic acid is known to be involved in brain activities... And many COVID-19 patients talk of 'foggy brain', 'memory loss', and so on... Is there any possibility that it was caused by this SARS-CoV-2 binding to silica acid receptor??

I’m excited to announce that the Smell and Taste Association of North America is being formed. Currently, there are no active patient organizations focused on smell and taste disorders in the United States of America. The aim of the Smell and Taste Association of North America (STANA) is to become this much-needed resource. STANA’s mission is to “provide a voice for people with smell and taste disorders through education and public awareness. We advocate for funding for research on smell and taste disorders. We collaborate with individuals living with these disorders, healthcare professionals, and institutions to provide evidence-based education, resources, and networking opportunities. We also partner with organizations around the world who are aligned with our vision to broaden our outreach.” 
STANA’s website is online at <http://www.thestana.org|www.thestana.org> and our fundraising website is <https://www.gofundme.com/f/organizing-the-smell-and-taste-association-of-na>. We are raising funds to pay for the startup costs of becoming an established 501c3 organization. If you are able to donate to help us get started, that would be much appreciated! If you are unable to donate at this time, please consider sharing the fundraising page with your networks so we can raise the funds needed to get established.

I know we are all R enthusiasts and it would be great if we could work together to perfect the figures for the next papers so that we can make the process fully replicable.

My idea would be to create a GCCR theme (I actually think <@U011LB61P36> first contributed this idea) and facilitate the creation of the creation of multipanel figures with all the details that the GCCR001 figures had.

Additionally it would be great to keep a collection of examples of tables and create a sort of useful codebook to share for graphics and tabulations.

Shiny is an R package that makes it easy to build interactive web apps straight from R. You can host standalone apps on a webpage or embed them in R Markdown documents or build dashboards. You can also extend your Shiny apps with CSS themes, htmlwidgets, and JavaScript actions.

1. We have prepared three documents that need translating (Translation, Translation responses and Error codes). Respect their structure and use the *exact same formatting* (bold, underlined...) for your final translation. This helps us identify what goes where later in the survey. Remember: we do not speak your language!
2. Do *NOT shorten any of the text, particularly not the consent form.* This can jeopardize our IRB approval.
3. Translations involve 3 steps: a) translate to the target language, b) translate back to English and c) discuss discrepancies between a) and b) and agree on a final translation. 
4. Submit the final translation (c) to me on this channel -  replace “LANGUAGE” with your language in English and tag me <@U011Y9CCJ6S> for this.

U011Y9CCJ6S,swahili,2020,09,10,2020-09-10,"Dear <!channel>, you expressed the interest in translating the *selfcheck tool* which allows people to track their sense of smell. Thank you very much for this initiative!  I will be the language coordinator that takes in charge the communication with the implementation team. There are two specific documents to translate, an excel document for the selfcheck tool itself, and an information word document.

The information document can be translated by one person only, as long as it is understandable by at least another people from this channel.
Concerning the excel document, it is different, there is a very specific procedure that is explained in the first sheet ""Instructions"". <@U010YDDCZRD> will be the supervisor and one of the forward translator (English to Swahili). <@U0179NJ2GNA> will be another forward translator. <@U01A29EV8GG> and Justin Cikomola will be the two back translators (Swahili to English). Please read carefully the instructions before starting to work. If you have any questions, just let me know. When the documents are completed, tag me here so I can transmit the information to the implementation team.

Important:
• some characters in red in the excel document have to stay exactly the same in the translation
• do not shorten or simplify the sentences
• some English sentences are the same than in the survey on which you already worked before. Thus, you need to be sure that they will be translated exactly in the same way than in the survey
Here are the links:

Hope you're doing fine.
Sorry for the delay in our reply. We needed to check the survey altogether to be sure everything is fine.
We have checked the online survey, and found a few errors. The phrases: ""Excellent sense of smell"" and ""Completely blocked"" (on the bars used to rate the ability to smell and how the nose was blocked) were not translated into Swahili and still appear in English. We've checked the translated word document (Version C) and found that these phrases were translated there (respectively: ""Hisia bora ya harufu"" and ""Imefungwa kabisa"").",message,

1 - When were you tested for COVID-19? not possible to write a date in ""tested on date:""
2-  What treatment(s) or medication have you received for this? A reponse is mandatory. However, maybe some people didn't took any treatment - should we propose ""leave blank""?
3- ""What medication do you take regularly?"". It is mentioned leave blank if you don't take anything regularly =&gt; However, giving an answer is mandatory to go further
4- « How blocked was your nose ». I feel the scoring is a bit confusing - spontanously I would say 10 is completey blocked. Maybe it would be less confusing to rephrase the question (i.e.""how patent"" or ""how did you rate nasal patency"")? It would then seems more logical than 10 means it is perfect
5- Since becoming ill, do smells 1)Smell different compared to before being ill (i.e. the quality of smell has changed) - maybe we should give a clear example like :when I smell coffee it smells like smoke; 2) Should we propose - « Smell normally »
6- Did you experience any other changes to tastes? Should we add a « No » proposal? If the patient chooses « Other » - should allow patients to specify?",message,

<https://testrun615.formr.org>

For deployment of the results, it's easier to go outside formr (e.g. shiny or opencpu apps, suggested by Ruben Arslan, former author) because the formr has a restriction that when using a run, only the data from that user is accessible. Attached is a shiny example

R code used for this .

##Access to the result stored in formr.

# need to apply for client ID and client Secret to get an access token

  grant_type = ""client_credentials""
)
request <- POST( ""<https://api.formr.org/oauth/access_token>"",
  body = login,
  encode = ""form""
)

response <- content(request)
access_token <- response$access_token

query <- list(
  access_token = access_token,
  ""run[name]"" = ""testrun615"")
 
request <- GET(""<https://api.formr.org/get/results>"", query=query)

But in the absence of evidence, for at least the <http://bit.ly|bit.ly> link I can guess at one explanation.

U010WRRC91A,webpage,2020,04,10,2020-04-10,"I agree that the current domain is not easy to remember so we could probably have another discussion about this. However, covidandsmell might suggest that we are only here to tackle olfaction-related issues due to covid (which is our current mission for sure) but it won't really help in our future projects. So it's a great idea, but not necessarily on the longer term. Maybe something like <http://chemosensory.org|chemosensory.org> would work ? Let's see what our website team
<@U010BNZ14KT> <@U010KDF9AVD> <@U010GME5DU4> <@U010D1HHU59> <@U010TS2UJKF> and social media team <@U010616MZ99> <@U010H1EC3J8> think !",message,

U010PB6729W,webpage,2020,04,10,2020-04-10,"I think we need something now - something to just get out there with press releases.  I'm not proposing a full formal domain name change, but rather something we can get out there.  the <http://bit.ly|bit.ly> doesn't work for people to remember from radio or tv.

I've registered <http://www.covidandsmell.com|www.covidandsmell.com> and it automatically routes to the GCCR webpage.  This is what people are associating with COVID, and it is what we are trying to increase awareness of.  I am happy to register and route whatever other domains people would like - it's pretty simple and easy to do. We could literally have dozens that just route to GCCR - just have to decide on what we want. <http://covidsmelltest.com|covidsmelltest.com> is already gone.",message,
U010BNZ14KT,webpage,2020,04,10,2020-04-10,"Hey all. I agree, the current domain isn't the best. We had to quickly get one, and didn't do the proper searches and planning we would have done otherwise.
That said, we wanted a domain that represented the organization, rather than just the current situation. <http://GCCR.org|GCCR.org> would have been awesome, but it was outrageously expensive. The other issue is our org name is a bit long just generally.

I like the idea of having another domain to point to the site. <@U010PB6729W> thank you for thinking of this. I like <http://covidandsmell.com|covidandsmell.com>. Particularly if we can get them into different languages.

One thing to keep in mind though is if this will effect anything in the future. Having 5 domains could be confusing to people. And if they only know one and we discontinue it due to cost, then we have broken links to deal with. We should also make sure that leadership doesnt see anything wrong with it (ie , whether the IRB restricts anything)",message,

U010BNZ14KT,webpage,2020,04,10,2020-04-10,"<@U010WRRC91A> That is definitely something to think about. And has crossed my mind. Generally, (similar to some of the privacy things) I think the situation, revelative speed and our generally small size will keep us safe. So we should think and plan for that sort of thing, but I don't think we should focus on it now.
I don;t think people will spam their websites. This would be obvious is they added them via the membership form, in which case... that would be a bold move on their part. I think there are issues with people signing up, as it is though, which I was going to bring up to folks, so I'll run these point by them",message,

U010BNZ14KT,webpage,2020,04,10,2020-04-10,"Also, just a PSA, but be mindful about the issues that we post to github. These are in the public domain, and searchable. Mainly, don't say anything about security issues, personal information, etc. Thanks all!",message,
U010GME5DU4,webpage,2020,04,11,2020-04-11,"I really second the idea that it's not only COVID: with the survey we are looking to reach out to individuals with all kinds of respiratory illnesses (including COVID) to investigate smell and taste experiences. If we are using additional domains, we need to make sure that we are targeting all of these aspects.  I will bring the issue to the leadership team and get back to you. Thank you for thinking about these issues though!",message,
U010WRRC91A,webpage,2020,04,11,2020-04-11,"As mentioned Thursday during our ""webpage meeting"" by <@U010BNZ14KT>, their are a few important things to consider when running a website that has Google Analytics (we need it to track the number of users, what kind of device they use, from which country...etc), as well as forms (both contact and membership), because we are collecting, or allowing a third-party to collect data. For this to be done we must ensure that we are GDPR compliant:
•  :negative_squared_cross_mark: users have to give their explicit consent *before* we collect their personal information. This includes Analytics, it shouldn't be activated until the user allows it.
•  :negative_squared_cross_mark: users should be able to *easily* modify (opt-in or opt-out) what kind of information we are allowed to collect.
•  :negative_squared_cross_mark: IP addresses should be anonymized (only used by Analytics, for the coding part we just have to add `ga('set', 'anonymizeIp', true);` in the appropriate location)
•  :ballot_box_with_check: cookie and data retention time, and the consent should not last more than 13 months (this should be configurable in Analytics directly)
I'm not sure about what we should do for the forms. They are sent to formspree so we likely have something to do here as well.
<https://github.com/Huitzilo|@Michael Schmuker > can you put the link that you shared during the meeting ? <https://www.cnil.fr/sites/default/files/atoms/files/draft_recommendation_cookies_and_other_trackers_en.pdf|Here >are up-to-date recommendations from the french regulatory body.

I'm also concerned about the license that covers everything published on the website (text content, the GCCR logo and banner, the sources displayed on GitHub). For now we have a permissive license (MIT License), which might not be adapted.
<https://github.com/mariaveldhuizen|@Maria Veldhuizen> <@U010GME5DU4>: neither <https://github.com/kwcooper|@keiland cooper >nor me are comfortable with the legal concerns, so it should probably be brought up to the leadership team at some point.",message,
U010D1HHU59,webpage,2020,04,11,2020-04-11,Re license: CC-BY should cover what we need. People should be able to use content as long as they acknowledge the GCCR. This would permit e.g. bloggers to use the banner when they promote the survey.,message,

U010BNZ14KT,webpage,2020,04,11,2020-04-11,"I've read up on this more. According to the GDPR and google analytics terms of use, you only need consent if you are using google analytics marketing and advertisement features. We're not.

_According to Google: ""Google’s policies prohibit Personally Identifiable Information (PII) to be sent to our systems""_ (anonymized IP) (Checkbox 3)

Thinking about it another way, if google was collecting this information through analytics, then it too would be breaking GDPR because it cannot verify user consent.",message,

I’ve gotten enough reports about the unreliability of the GitHub page that I think it may be worth investigating other hosting options.

We are launching a GCCR newsletter in September and would love your input. We’d like to use Mailchimp to format and send the newsletter. It’s free for our level of membership and will give us some helpful metrics. I can set it up, assuming we are able to do a few things: 
Mailchimp is a web-based application. To set it up we need to provide an email address that will be associated with the account. They use that email to verify and communicate so it needs to be an email I (or someone else working on the newsletter) has access to. They say “It's best to send email campaigns with a personal or a company domain. Many free email providers have implemented <https://mailchimp.com/help/limitations-of-free-email-addresses/|DMARC authentication policies> that affect the delivery of email campaigns that use a free provider's domain for the From email address.” Are we able to set up such an email through our website? 

 Also, <@U010KDF9AVD> Maria, because of anti-spam regulations we must include a <https://mailchimp.com/help/alternative-physical-address-ideas/|physical mailing address> in all emails. Please let me know what i should use.

STANA - The Smell and Taste Association of North America.

""To smell the roses and taste the spice of life."" We are a patient advocacy group formed in 2020 to improve the quality-of-life for people with smell and taste disorders since we recognize that the loss of taste or smell can affect health, safety and emotional well-being. We seek to expand research, education and treatments for people living in North America who are experiencing the invisible loss of these senses.

Dear <@U010TS2UJKF>,
please meet <@U015WQMNG48> and <@U015BUEAEEQ>, two Temple students who have very enthusiastically offered their help to the GCCR.
 In preparation for our resizing of the Slack subscription at the end of the month, I would be most grateful if we could save the relevant links and files to the GCCR drive. Some of these should already be in the <https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15o2pzavcqxmoR3FRz-4zu7RmSwVxsJmM?usp=sharing|GCCR drive>, but not all.
<@U010KDF9AVD> has previously cleaned up some of channels and could have great insights on how to go about this.
Let me know if something is not clear and if there is some help on my part that is needed.
Thank you all for the assistance with this task: it will facilitate communication among members as well as maintain important materials in one place.
Best,
Valentina",message,

A safe bet is that of duplicate files only the most recent should be kept.

• I think we need to create some groups of channels that one of two point-persons can keep an eye out on. Note cross-posting, refer people to a similar but better fitting channel, tell me when a new channel came into being and needs to be added to Slack map, merge channels that are similar etc
• These groups could be ""literature"", ""new projects"", ""social media"" etc
• These persons could also produce a ""digest"" for key_announcements with whatever frequency is appropriate. 
• I will probably bring in some more people to help us with this, but I also wanted to ask you for your opinion and if you feel like you may have gotten affinity with such a group of channel that you want your pick first :wink:

U010KDF9AVD,_0_welcome,2020,05,16,2020-05-16,"*Welcome to the GCCR slack, happy to see you found your way here!* 

We are with 700+ people in the consortium and need to organize the communication in a different manner than through email or chat. This is what Slack is for. This is basically a ""discussion forum"" style communication app. The basic organization unit is a ""channel""  which covers a specific topic. Within each channel you will find posts in chronological order.  You can also directly chat with individuals through Direct Messages. Please take a look at <https://slack.com/resources/slack-101|this tutorial> and our post <https://gccr-mql6351.slack.com/archives/C013BD495MM/p1589616038012300|""how do I reply""> below to help us keep Slack organized.

*So you got here, now what?* 
All of the communication in the consortium is happening on Slack. You are automatically added a few important channels. Note that you have to actively join channels and engage on the channels to get involved in any consortium activities. So the next thing you should do is to join some channels that you are interested in.

We have 100+ channels. There are country specific channels, channels for projects that are running and/or being prepared (for example <#C010KLR8YRL|covid-19hometest>) and a channel for new project proposals being prepared (<#C01364E7WBY|projectideas>). There are channels to see information coming out about GCCR (<#C011D1CDB7Y|press_releases>, <#C010B3U8GDP|twitter_gcchemosensoryr>) or opportunities to contribute (<#C012JK0MDG8|visuals>, <#C010YPDH98X|translation_needed>, <#C012JK0MDG8|visuals>). For a more complete list, see our post <https://gccr-mql6351.slack.com/archives/C013BD495MM/p1589617084015900|""A map of our Slack channels""> below

*Introduce yourself!*
Please say hi on the <#C011K96TV0W|_0_introduce_yourself_here> channel. Tell us a little bit about what you work on and what brought you to the consortium. We aim to be inclusive, and hope you won't be shy, even if your English may not be perfect or you think you are the only non-scientist (you're not).

*Check that you actually signed the membership agreement?* 
You probably received the invite to join Slack because you signed the agreement, but if you for example received an invite directly from a colleague, please go <https://gcchemosensr.org/join/|to our webpage>, scroll to the bottom and click ""Become a member"".  You can check if you are on <https://gcchemosensr.org/members/|the member list> here, but note that this is not automatically updated. If you want to change anything about your membership information or status, please send a direct message to <@U010KDF9AVD>.

*Create an entry in the GCCR skills database*
We have created a skills database to facilitate GCCR-project focused collaboration* *among GCCR members.  We invite you to enter your information in <https://forms.gle/zaFLGtusNEXPYu7E7|this form> and tell us about your interests.
After you fill out the database you can see summaries of other people’s responses, but if you are looking for people with specific skills, <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1boluXQ6QyWfAK6jMFHOlmfPfru9qD81N8mt6H5PLKoE/edit?usp=sharing|here is view-only link of the database>.
If you don’t remember whether you already filled this out, just search for yourself under <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1boluXQ6QyWfAK6jMFHOlmfPfru9qD81N8mt6H5PLKoE/edit?usp=sharing|that same link>.
If you want to change your answers, just go to <https://forms.gle/zaFLGtusNEXPYu7E7|the form itself>. There you can change any specific answer without having to do everything over.

*How do I reply and join channels?* 
Please take a look at this tutorial  <https://slack.com/resources/slack-101|this tutorial>  and our post <https://gccr-mql6351.slack.com/archives/C013BD495MM/p1589616038012300|""how do I reply""> below to help us keep Slack organized.

Channels can quickly become messy and then it becomes hard to find topics. The way the Slack interface is designed it is easy to overlook the reply button and just type in the text field directly below the topic. That will actually create a new topic and then the message are no longer organized together in a ""thread"".

Here is how you should reply to a message:",message,

In the bar on the left there is a item called ""channels"" that lists the channels you automatically joined.

You can find channels to join or create channels by clicking the + next to the that item (first image below).

The list of channels will be visible in the center window of you slack app now and the list is long enough to need two tabs, so check the second tab if you can't find what you are looking for. Do you see the channel that you want to join, click it and then in the window on the right side click the + join icon (second image below).",message,

*Vision*
The Global Consortium on Chemosensory Research (GCCR) has been started with the aim of uniting chemosensory scientists worldwide to understand reports of the chemosensory issues related to COVID-19.

More broadly, the GCCR aspires to define, coordinate, and disseminate global efforts to advance the scientific understanding and clinical practice related to the chemical senses.

*Mission*
The timely mission of the GCCR is to define and coordinate world-wide crowdsourced research to understand the reports of the chemosensory issues related to COVID-19.

Subsequently, the establishment of this consortium will foster the advancement of chemosensory science at large, allowing the possibility to test larger samples of participants cross-culturally, strengthening the reliability and validity of chemosensory science across many domains.

In accomplishing this mission, the GCCR’s primary roles are to work cooperatively with its members to:

• Encourage and facilitate global collaboration in concert with local collaboration across countries, labs, scientists and clinicians interested in the chemical senses. Members can access the protocols and data deriving from the GCCR’s projects and adapt them to their local needs. Participation in this consortium does not preclude local efforts.
• Encourage and facilitate the implementation of open science practices the GCCR projects will allow the members as well as the community at large to access protocols and data.
• Encourage and facilitate the development and dissemination of new knowledge by authoring papers based on the core data collected by the GCCR as a group.
*Authorship*
One of the goals of the GCCR is dissemination of the data collected. In published work, authors will be listed in tiers according to their contributions, which will be specified in the publication(s). Within tiers, authors will be listed in alphabetical order. The core data will be published by the GCCR altogether. Local groups may use such data as part of a project, but may not report only on a portion of the core data.

*Data sharing*
Protocols as well as code used to process results will be made available in the effort of fostering reproducibility within the GCCR and in the scientific community at large.

*Leadership team*
The leadership team is responsible for facilitating communication within the GCCR, organizing the GCCR meetings and coordinating the group’s efforts.

The leadership committee is composed of a Chair and members, currently (in alphabetical order): John Hayes; Thomas Hummel; Chrissi Kelly; Steve Munger; Masha Niv; Kathrin Ohla; Valentina Parma (chair); Danielle Reed; Maria Veldhuizen.

GCCR procedures are proposed by the leadership team to all members which collectively guide the direction of the GCCR through the procedures they support.",message,

The Global Consortium of Chemosensory Research (GCCR) welcomes scientists, clinicians, patient advocates, and other stakeholders to contribute to our mission: to define, coordinate, and disseminate global efforts to advance scientific understanding and clinical practice related to the chemical senses.

As GCCR members, we are committed to create a positive environment for all members of the GCCR across all GCCR platforms (e.g., Slack channel, Twitter, Facebook, email, etc.). All subscribers to those platforms are expected to abide by the GCCR Code of Conduct.

*Expected Behavior*
The following statements identify expected behavior on all GCCR platforms:

• Treat all participants with respect and consideration, valuing a diversity of views and opinions.
• Be considerate, respectful, and collaborative.
• Communicate openly and with respect for others, keeping criticism constructive (e.g., behavior-focused, specific, solution-oriented).
• Avoid personal attacks directed toward other participants.
• Favor data accountability and transparency
• Alert the GCCR leadership team if you notice a dangerous situation or someone in distress.
*Unacceptable Behavior*
The following statements identify behavior that is unacceptable when interacting on GCCR platforms and will not be tolerated.

• Harassment, intimidation or discrimination in any form.
• Abuse in any form of any GCCR participant.
• Specific examples of unacceptable behavior include, but are not limited to, verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, national origin that are meant to intimidate, insult or otherwise harm; inappropriate use of nudity and/or sexual images in public spaces or in presentations; threatening or stalking any GCCR participant.
• Fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism in proposing, performing, reviewing or reporting research results
• Breach of the terms of the GCCR agreement
*Consequences*
Anyone requested to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.
The GCCR leadership team may take any action deemed necessary and appropriate, e.g., a verbal warning or immediate removal from GCCR platforms without warning, or removal from GCCR membership.
The GCCR reserves the right to prohibit participation in its activities.
If you are the subject of unacceptable behavior or have witnessed any such behavior, please immediately notify the Leadership team.

I've also added a few of our members that I know have done research or teaching in Africa in our field, and maybe they have helpful insights or contacts every now and then.

I would like to ask your assistance with the following: we have a few GCCR members in Africa that are not registered on Slack and maybe someone can reach out to them directly, to see if they would be interested in becoming more active. Let me know and I'll be able to give you email addresses.

U010GME5DU4,_argentina,2020,04,09,2020-04-09,"Dear All, it is very important that the Spanish translation in completed soon so that we can disseminate the questionnaire. Considering that the translation has been started here, we can keep this channel as the one to complete the translation. Other Spanish speakers have been included.

For the translation to be considered, here are the steps that need to be followed:
1.    *Original* (English) document
is translated from source to target language by A Translator/s resulting in document Version A.

2.    *Back-translation*: Version A is
translated back from target to English language by B Translator/s independently resulting in Version B.

3.    *Discussion*: Version A and B are discussed among all translators, discrepancies in Version A and B are detected and solutions are discussed. Version C is created and voted by majority.

4.    *Report*: Country leaders report the names of all A and B translator/s, as well as the results of the vote on Version C (number of favorable votes/all translators). At least two A and two B translators are strongly suggested.


The two files to translate from English to Spanish (version A) and back from Spanish to English (version B) are those attached here.  Then you must agree on a final version C which is going to be submitted to <@U010KM0A4KG> She will pass them to the team that is including the questionnaires in Compusense. The excel file is meant to help speed up that process. Without ALL the documents translated, the Spanish questionnaire cannot be <http://shared.Co|s>hared.

Considering the reach that Spanish has worldwide we would like to include it as soon as possible in Compusense and deploy it. This is one of the reasons why it was included int he first batch of languages to be deployed.",message,

U011BFNUL78,_argentina,2020,04,09,2020-04-09,"Dear all, it's a pleasure to work with you on this shared project.

To speed up the work, I took the liberty to use the previous Spanish version shared in this channel (thank you <@U010M3MTW23> and all those who worked on it) and edited based on the final template (GCCR_translation_template3). I also translated the excel file, so attached you can find both the final Word and Excel files listed in the previous post. 

Who can be the other A translator that could check this last version? Perhaps those who already worked on the English to Spanish version? Can you please list who you are so that I can include you in the final word file as A translators (I worked using in part the version provided by Sajidxa Mariño, Patricia Portillo Mazal and Graciela Soler, but I might be overlooking someone)? 

Then we need at least one back-translator (better if two), that will translate this last Spanish version back to English to check for inaccuracies. No A translator can be a back translator. Who among you can act as back translator ?

Then we need to agree on a C version together and submit our version. 

Looking forward to hearing from you soon (although I know that for many of you it's early!),

- In the question ""Con qué género se identifica más"" (""Which gender do you most identify with?""), the alternative ""Otro/a no listado aquí"" (Another not listed here) should be corrected as ""Otro no listado aquí"", Although this does not represent a problem to understand this item.
- When asking ""What date did you first notice symptoms of your recent respiratory illness?"", next to the answer box the example (Ej.,) is not provided; maybe ""Ej."" should be removed.
- In the rating scales used for items such as ""Rate your ability to smell BEFORE your recent respiratory illness or diagnosis"", the text ""Excellent sense of smell"" appears in English;; it should say ""Excelente sentido del olfato"".
- In ""Have you experienced any of the following changes in smell with your recent respiratory illness diagnosis?"", the alternative ""Los olores huelen diferente como lo hacían antes (la calidad del olfato ha cambiado)"" should say ""Los olores huelen diferente *a* como lo hacían antes (la calidad del olfato ha cambiado)"".
- The text of the rating scales used for items such as ""¿Qué tan bloqueada/ tapada estaba su nariz DURANTE su enfermedad o diagnóstico respiratorio reciente?"" (""How blockedwas your nose BEFORE your recentrespiratory illness or diagnosis?"") are displayed in English; it should say ""Para nada bloqueada/tapada"" (left) and ""Completamente bloqueada"" (right).
- The same as above applies for the scale of items like ""Califique su sentido de gusto ANTES de su enfermedad o diagnóstico respiratorio reciente"" (""Rate your ability to taste BEFORE your recent respiratory illness or diagnosis""); it should say ""Sin sentido del gusto"" (left) and ""Excelente sentido del gusto"" (right). 
- The text ""Very sensitive"" should say ""Muy sensible"" in the rating scale for items like ""Califique su capacidad de sentir estas otras sensaciones ANTES de su enfermedad o diagnóstico respiratorio reciente"" (""Rate your ability to feel these other sensations BEFORE your recent respiratory illness or diagnosis"").
- The question ""¿Tuvo algun*o* de las siguientes patologías en los 6 meses previos a su enfermedad o diagnóstico respiratorio reciente?

U0107DF9NQH,_argentina,2020,04,14,2020-04-14,"En relación a este tema acabo de elaborar estos conceptos: 
<https://www.clarin.com/ciudades/coronavirus-argentina-plata-hacen-test-olfato-detectar-pacientes-asintomaticos_0_pZmi1R40f.html|https://www.clarin.com/ciudades/coronavirus-argentina-plata-hacen-test-olfato-detectar-pacientes-asintomaticos_0_pZmi1R40f.html>

Este es un ejemplo de los tests sencillos que están realizando en Argentina, para detectar hiposmia- anosmia en los controles de conductores de auto. 
Están basados en un test similar iniciado por militares estadounidenses, quienes usaron vinagre, para el mismo fin. Ahora también agregan otros olores, como lo dice <@U010GN5UADR>Explico: 
1.	el vinagre es una sustancia, que tiene dos componentes: el olor en sí, que es percibido por el NERVIO OLFATORIO (las neuronas están en el techo de las fosas nasales) y el componente TRIGEMINAL (terminaciones libres del nervio trigémino, V par-nervio craneal, que llegan a las mucosas de los ojos, la nariz, garganta): son sensaciones tipo frescura, ardor, pinchazo, cosquilleo,  y es esto lo que nos hace decir “es fuerte, me pica, me arde”. Es el mecanismo de defensa que tenemos para “huir del peligro, de irritantes”.
2.	El otro tema es la IDENTIFICACIÓN de OLORES: es un proceso psicofísico: al presentar un olor al paciente, una vez que lo percibe, la información continúa por las vías olfatorias hasta áreas del cerebro, es aquí donde el olor se interpreta, se intelectualiza, se pone un nombre: eso es identificar. Decir que la sustancia que olí antes, es vinagre.
3.	El proceso de identificación debe cumplir 3 requisitos: a. El olor debe ser familiar, el sujeto testado debe conocerlo; b. Debe haber una clara asociación entre el olor y su nombre, el cerebro interpreta qué es y c. Se debe ayudar al sujeto si manifiesta duda en el momento de identificar. No se puede identificar, nombrar un olor, si no vemos el nombre en una lista o si no nos dan a elegir el nombre correcto junto a distractores, o choise.

Lo que hay que hacer: elegir 2 olores (jabón liquido perfumado y alcohol/vinagre) y un blanco (una tirita o un hisopo sin olor, o mojada con agua).
Procedimiento: 
A.	presentarle a 2 cm de las fosas nasales, primero el hisopo con agua (blanco) y le preguntamos qué percibe: dirá que no percibe nada, que no sabe qué es.
B.	Presentarle el hisopo con jabón líquido y decirle si percibe algo y luego si puede decir  qué es, dándole 3 alternativas, choise: ejemplo, es chocolate, jabón o naranja? Esto es imprescindible: pues sin este dato, es muy difícil identificar,  poner el nombre, por lo explicado antes.
C.	Presentarle el hisopo con alcohol/vinagre y hacer lo mismo que el paso anterior. En este caso si siente solo la parte irritante/fresco, pero no puede decir que es, con las alternativas dadas, choise, (vainilla, café o alcohol/vinagre? se puede considerar que el paciente está en anosmia: no puede oler, puede sentir solo la irritación. El paciente normal dice que le irrita y escoge el nombre correcto, dice que es alcohol/vinagre. Lo mismo puede ocurrir con una hiposmia: huele poco.

Es solo información para que se pueda instruir a los colegas o voluntarios que están en los puntos de control, además de un breve interrogatorio para preguntar si el olfato lo perdió en forma brusca, entre febrero y marzo de 2020 o si ya padecía alteraciones del olfato, previo a esto, ejemplo, rinitis o rinosinusitis crónica o cualquier otra enfermedad que ya le había afectado el olfato antes de esta fecha.

Espero haber aportado el conocimiento básico sobre este tema tan difundido en este momento.
Ante cualquier duda, se comunican por privado o a mi email: <mailto:dragracielasoler@yahoo.com.ar|dragracielasoler@yahoo.com.ar>
Muchas gracias.

Te cuento que he tenido conversaciones con los comités de bioética de acá y me han sugerido que se apruebe esta encuesta en Chile para poder distribuirla libremente. Tú sabes que con la ley Ricarte Soto las cosas están muy reguladas acá. La buena noticia es que el Comité de Bioética de la Facultad de Medicina de la Universidad de Chile va a revisar todo el próximo martes.

Una vez esa aprobación esté podremos  difundirla libremente y usando los canales oficiales de Hospitales e Instituciones/Universidades Chilenas y prensa que es donde podemos encontrar a la mayoría de los pacientes. De lo contrario solo queda difusión en RRSS y bueno.. un alcance menor de la población objetivo. Lo ideal es contactar a médicos intensivistas que estén en la primera línea para que aporten... yo tengo un nombre del Hospital Clínico de la U de Chile y un amigo en la Clínica las Condes los cuales podrían contactar.

Es un q-test de 2 kits de 3 aromas para detectar anosmia en asintomaticos que trabajan o acuden a empresas y hospitales, los cuales son  vectores imprtantes de propagacion del  virus como saben. Hems estado en contacto para esto con Patricia Portillo de Buenos Aires que esta en algo similar.

Given the low number of responses from the current Chinese survey, we might receive even fewer responses for this self-test.

Thank you very much for this initiative!  I will be the language coordinator that takes in charge the communication with the implementation team. There are two specific documents to translate, an excel document for the selfcheck tool itself, and an information word document.

The  information document can be translated by one person only, as long as it is understandable by at least another people from this channel. Concerning the excel document, it is different, there is a very specific procedure that is explained in the first sheet ""Instructions"". *Jan Havlíček* will be the supervisor. <@U010CULHM5G>  and *Lucie Kuncováone* will be the forward translators (English to Czech). *Lenka Kysilková* and  <@U011BGADVL6> will be the two back translators (Czech to English). Please read carefully the instructions before starting to work. If you have any questions, just let me know. When the documents are completed, tag me here so I can transmit the information to the  implementation team.

Important:
• some characters in red in the excel document have to stay exactly the same in the translation
• do not shorten or simplify the sentences
• some English sentences are the same than in the survey on which you already worked before. Thus, you need to be sure that they will be translated exactly in the same way than in the survey

Here are the links:

U011LF2MKHT,_filipino,2020,06,03,2020-06-03,"<@U011Y9CCJ6S> Thanks. I wonder if this is ever going to get implemented. It has been more than a month since I started with the translation. Does it really take this long for any language to get implemented? Just wondering. Anyhow, I have other commitments so it would be great to know a timeframe just so I can organize around it somehow. What would you suggest? Should I give up on this?",message,
U011Y9CCJ6S,_filipino,2020,06,03,2020-06-03,"Dear <@U011LF2MKHT> , yes I think it takes time because the implementation team is working on different langages at the same time, and they also work as researchers or doctors in parallel. That is why it takes so much time. You did most of the work, they just need to implement your corrections and you will have to validate the survey again. Then the last step will be to translate a quick document about tweets. I can already give it to you now (you can find it attached) and you can translate when you have time. It is not in a hurry because it is the last step. Do not give up, you did an amazing work already! Probably the survey can be available in one or two weeks, depending on how many langages are in progress at the same time. This is a ""pessimistic"" estimation, it can also be released in few days. If you have any other questions, do not hesitate.",message,

I hope you are well. <@U010GN5UADR> and I are organizing an outreach activity for ISOT (August 3rd-August 7th) and we would like for this to be COVID-related and very international.

To achieve this goal, we ask for your help.

Our proposal is to create language virtual rooms in which for max 1 hour people can:

1. gain knowledge on what  smell, taste and chemesthesis are and how COVID can affect them. We are preparing an infographic that can be used across languages for that.

2.  experience  two demos that are included in the AChemS Education Corner website:
• Flavor is multisensory (jelly bean test) <https://achems.org/web/resources-education-activity-1.php>
• Chemosensory adaptation <https://achems.org/web/resources-education-activity-3.php>

3. ask questions about smell and taste.

We'd love to organize one of these sessions in French, which can be place at a friendly time for France or Canada.  Would any of you be willing to help out? And if not, would you be able to suggest someone who could?

Thank you in advance for considering,

Valentina",message,

I hope you are well. <@U010GN5UADR> and I are organizing an outreach activity for ISOT (August 3rd-August 7th) and we would like for this to be COVID-related and very international.

To achieve this goal, we ask for your help.

Our proposal is to create language virtual rooms in which for max 1 hour people can:

1. gain knowledge on what  smell, taste and chemesthesis are and how COVID can affect them. We are preparing an infographic that can be used across languages for that.

2.  experience  two demos that are included in the AChemS Education Corner website:
• Flavor is multisensory (jelly bean test) <https://achems.org/web/resources-education-activity-1.php>
• Chemosensory adaptation <https://achems.org/web/resources-education-activity-3.php>

3. ask questions about smell and taste.

We'd love to organize one of these sessions in German, which can be place at a friendly time for Germany and Switzerland.  Would any of you be willing to help out? And if not, would you be able to suggest someone who could?

Thank you in advance for considering,

Valentina",message,

U010H6AKZH9,_indiaa,2020,03,27,2020-03-27,"Here is the response for the back translation:  Though it was technically correct but I found lack of coherence at some places which usually happens when we translate it using some application/ tool as it translates the words/ lines without the coherence in which they are spoken regionally. Also, Feeling and Sense mean different. The Hindi translation of “Feeling’ is ‘Bhawna’ which has been used in hindi version but I believe it should be replaced with ‘Samajh’, a simple hindi word for sense as this questionnaire seems to be used by masses who should be able to understand it in simple language.

As individuals, we can participate in developing and advertizing the questionnaire/test/other materials with no problems.  However, if as scientists we want to either promote and/or utilize the data created, we need permissions. I will be getting these through DAE (our parent ministry) and the Human Ethics Committee here, and will include you all as co-PIs as you like.

It seems even for within TIFR system, Institutional Ethics committee approval for human research will be required separately for each center. DAE approval will apply pan-center. Another option might be to direct people to an online link that collects responses, such as Noam Sobel's test. The data then will be handled off site and I guess since no research will be performed with the human data in-house, this could be a grey area regarding approval?",message,

U010H6AKZH9,_indiaa,2020,04,03,2020-04-03,"<@U010YA0EAE8> and all.  This is exactly what I checked on so let me clarify.  There are 3 ways to go about it.  First, the questionnaire will be online at a single site and will have all our translations.  The Global IRB allows us to AS INDIVIDUALS direct people to this questionnaire without issue.  The issue comes in if we AS SCIENTISTS want to promote and/or utilize the data in our institutes.  So for this, Second, we need to get HEC permission.  I need DAE permission for TIFR, but that of course only applies to Adish and I.  We can get group HEC permission if we want to consider ourselves co-PIs in this effort and this should work at your institute as well.  I have been part of the HEC so am aware that multi-instutional projects are supported. The Third option is that we each get our own permissions, which is self-explanatory.",message,

In case later is the case, he requested more details. Till then, I will wait for others opinion on it.",message,
U010H6AKZH9,_indiaa,2020,04,03,2020-04-03,<@U0116A1TGFN> exactly.  Getting permission for the analysis we can likely use the approved IRB proposal as I have been told by my HEC (IRB).,message,

Since we already have the drafts in place, I was thinking to save time we could give the A and B translation WITH the new text below and the excel sheet above to a THIRD person (C) to fill in and then send the final to all translators (A, B and C) for a check. This might be quicker than chasing down everyone at once. What do you say?  I have people for:

Hindi
Kannada 
Gujarati 
Marathi
Oriya
Tamil

But I’ll need help with the others (Bengali, Punjabi, Urdu, Assamese, Malayalam)

Can you help get these others filled out in the forms below and the excel sheet above? Let me know if this plans sounds ok and I’ll keep you updated on the IRB?

Thank you so much for offering to help the GCCR! 

You are Translator C. We have had a translator A convert an earlier draft of the questionnaire into the language and a second translator B translate from the language back into English for checking.

You now have these versions.

What you need to do:
1. Change the LANGUAGE in the name of the attached word document GCCR_tranlation_template2_LANGUAGE.docx to your language.
2. Fill in that word document with the equivalent translations. Most of these should be the same as the A and B translations you were given, but there are a couple of places with word changes, and the initial consent form needs translation (it was just approved on Tuesday). 
3. Change the LANGUAGE in the name of the attached excel sheet GCCR_tranlation_responses_LANGUAGE to your language.
4. Fill in the translated words. These are needed to help make sure the online form is correct.
5. Please send these 2 documents back to me include your name and affiliation in the email body.
6. Upon receipt you will receive a second group email for all translators, A, B and C. The three of you must consent to the final documents by responding TO ALL in an email. Once everyone confirms the final translation, it will be sent to the consortium for uploading.
If you can do Steps 1-4 by Friday Evening 17:00 IST that would help us stay on target for a launch next week. Please let me know if you need more time.

Thanks so much,

Dear Translators,

Thank you so much for taking the time to translate and back-translate our questionnaire. The English and German versions can already be viewed at: <https://gcchemosensr.org/>. Our language will be included as soon as we have the necessary approvals (which are in progress). 

WHAT WE NEED YOUR HELP WITH:
In order to follow proper protocols, ALL translators for a particular language must approve the final version. In this case, we have 3 persons participating - one to translate the questionnaire draft, one to back translate, and one to compile these edits into a final draft including the consent form. Country leaders (myself in this case) are to share Version C and report the results of the vote on Version C (number of favorable votes/all translators). 

1. A-Translation by [Pratheek HP] on [27/3/20]
2. B-Translation by [Pavan Kaushik] on [27/3/20]
3. C-Version compiled by [Geetha GT] on [10/08/20]

Please see the attached versions. I request you to send an email REPLY ALL indicating ONE of the following:
1. I request edits to the version (and indicate those requests)
2. I approve this version
If you can do this by MONDAY APRIL 13 at 5pm IST, then we can role out this language onto the international site ASAP!

1) we have 7 languages already in the pipeline for online translation: Hindi, Tamil, Marathi, Kannada, Urdu, Gujarati, and Punjabi.
2) 4 languages are still in process: Bengali, Malayalam, Oriya and Telegu. Can anyone update on their status? Oriya is in the weeds - but I am trying to pull it through.
3) we have some in country ethical approvals now. I will preset for my committee tomorrow. Who else is in process?
4) we should work on our press release. Do we want to use a version of the one sent by Valentina, or write our own (I have attached a draft with our institutes mentioned). Can we discuss and edit? Do you want to make it more exciting?
5) we should slowly transition to the self-assessment test. I haven’t seen the final version of the consortium document, so i don’t know how implementable it will be in India. I like the idea of pictorial presentation and very simple ingredients (kitchen masala notwithstanding). Can we discuss this?

Please let me know your thoughts. To keep things organized, please start your response as to the item number (e.g. #2. I am working on Telegu or #4 I have edits for the press release, etc).

1. the 4 languages are still in process for the questionnaire: Bengali, Malayalam, Oriya and Telegu. 
2. ethical approvals

U010H6AKZH9,_indiaa,2020,05,11,2020-05-11,A reminder of the meeting today at 2 PM IST Today,message,

U010H6AKZH9,_indiaa,2020,05,12,2020-05-12,"1. Why is the survey response low in India?
           -reach was wide, but participation low
           -high link clicks, low follow through
           -surveys are not generally popular
           -consent form was intimidating
           -survey was long
           -site was slow
           -We only know about Indian languages, not responses in English
2. Given the issues with 1, the need to have the data stored in India for ethical reasons, and the desire to tie up with government to get better likelihood of participation, we should try to be part of the Aarogya Setu app
3. To do this, CSIR-CSIO <@U010SGDUGN4> <@U010EFYSYTT> will try to get ethical permission for a small 100-200 subject trial of the self test using Google Forms to provide proof of concept for the test
4. <@U010YNNS9BQ>, NCBS will prepare the form currently with the GCCR stimuli, and to be substituted with other stimuli as this is determined by <@U0116A1TGFN>
5. <@U010H6AKZH9> will contact GCCR leadership today to get a copy of the stimuli being considered to prepare this form with <@U010YNNS9BQ>",message,
U010YNNS9BQ,_indiaa,2020,05,12,2020-05-12,"So I just created a tiny pilot form which captures most of the items in the sheet we made. Do check it out and edit it as needed.

U010SGDUGN4,_indiaa,2020,05,16,2020-05-16,"For hospital setting, he will prefer scratch and sniff test than home ingredients. For pilot, we will propose that hospital will help us to share the survey with patients. Chandigarh doesn't have many patients which is awesome but sample size will be small ( most prob less than 100)",message,
U010YNNS9BQ,_indiaa,2020,05,16,2020-05-16,"My approach has been to find the smallest set of items while making sure people from all regions will have at least one of the item in each list. 

I removed as many as I could. While also making sure, these items are fairly similar for our purposes. Each list has mostly 3-4 items. 

Except for the spice mix which is 5 as that's way too diverse. The spice mix well never be the same even from household to household and cannot be compared across. But it is a potent mix with multitudes of aromatic volatiles. Coupled with the nostalgia of eating it all their life, if one fails to smell this, something is very likely off. A mini acid test by itself. 


I've added all the images. Most are cc. Except for commercial products for which I couldn't find any cc license. I'm not sure, but shouldn't be an issue I guess for now. If anything, it is free marketing for them:shrug::skin-tone-5:

Is there any other questions that needs to be added to the form? Contact details, illness onset, comorbidities etc?

Suggestions-
1. Do you think we can work without cigarette in item 7? If not, then it is OK.
2. I think we should also ask  contact details (not compulsory), co-morbidity and onset (not compulsory).",message,

Since it isn't mandatory, and we aren't asking to smoke of only cigarettes, thought isn't a health hazard.

As we discussed, we hoped that providing the self assessment test in conjunction with the existing survey could help boost our numbers, especially if it could be combined with some of the National efforts on this front. But this seems to be going slowly and we have seen little progress on this for the past 2 weeks. <@U010GME5DU4>  has mentioned that the GCCR leadership is keen to get more data from India. As you also know, I have also requested help with leading this part of our efforts as it is not my main expertise. Could one of you in this channel please step in and help push this forward? Our numbers are still pitifully low for India despite our social and mass media reach and at this rate we will likely not have enough results to make any claims about the Indian population.

1. *Taste:* Should we keep Umami category? GCCR doesn't have one. I think we should keep it.
2. *Olfaction:* GCCR has 4 groups for olfaction: Cosmetics or detergents, spices or herbs, fruits or vegetables, and other items. We have 6 groups +1 nasal irritants group. Should we merge them to maintain consistency with GCCR? Please look at the *Sheet 2* at this link <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B35-BRZBn-nJe_hAXsfigt5YzaWWb7JK2ThIELsNJxA/edit?usp=sharing>.

2.2 We don't have fruits or vegetable group. Do we want to include it? As mentioned by Pavan, they are way too variable to a large extent
3.  *Nasal Irritants:* Should we keep holy basil and mint leaves? We already have mustard, Vicks Vaporub® and Camphor

2.1 neutral to having masal mix
2.2 fruits and veges is a good option but not sure with diversity what do we include. Ssince its mango seasons. I am able to think of manago which smells very intense when ripe. Melons can also be added
3. Nasal irritant: I think its better to have basil and mint. I cant think that every household which will have vaporrub or camphor. Atleast my house never have these two items. most household will have tulsi
4. Oral irritant : not sure about polo, i dont think so it is readily available in household. people will start buying it to test that. I think fresh mint is good for ""cooling from mint""

On a side not I noticed in excel sheet item 7, there is cigarette, smoke and burnt hair. I hope people not start burning hair in large amount after reading that. Maybe we can omit that",message,
U010H6AKZH9,_indiaa,2020,06,03,2020-06-03,I think we should add some fruits and vegetables to be consistent with the larger GCCR survey.,message,
U010YNNS9BQ,_indiaa,2020,06,03,2020-06-03,"1. We should have the umami taste section.

2. Does having more sections break consistency with gccr. Since we will still be a super set in some sense as we capture all their receptor categories and some more. Merging also has minor squirm about way too many items in one category.

2.1 I would vote a yes for the masala. This is because, a person is very likely going to test what is there at home. And that is almost certainly what their native cuisine masala is. What they grew up all their life on. As this has all sorts of compounds and is broad spectrum source. If an individual can't smell something so nostalgic and regular item in their lives, with little novelty in their composition, it is a clear red flag. Very likely case of anosmia. 

2.2 I agree.  Since this test is going to be for long time, something throughout the year might be better. <@U010SGDUGN4> suggestions are great. We should add them.

3. Tulasi and mint are common and similar throughout the country. Helps in accessibility. Unless we want to cut out items, we can keep it. 

4. Eno/soda would be great. Polo, I dunno about rural areas.",message,

U010SGDUGN4,_indiaa,2020,06,18,2020-06-18,"Hi everyone, I have received a few comments from Kathrin.
• *""tea""*: I was wondering what kind you had in mind - brewed or leavers? any particular type, e.g. green, black, fruit? Shall we specify this?
• *Tastes* (Tamarind, kokam/Garcinia spp, Neem leaves, Fenugreek seeds, Black salt, Ajinomoto, Soy sauce): I noticed that these are flavorants (smell+taste), not tastants. So using them in the taste test protocol as it is now (without pinching the nose) will likely result in ratings of retronasal olfaction and not taste. That will make it hard to compare to our test. In an earlier version of the test we had a ""flavor"" condition included, where people would sample foods and rate twice: first with their nose pinched (taste) and then with the nose open (retronasal olfaction).
• *Oral irritants*: Is ""ENO"" like table salt? If so, it would not be irritating but salty. And for the ""Mint leaves"" I wondered whetehr you have a soecial type of mint in mind (there are so many)?
",message,
U0116A1TGFN,_indiaa,2020,06,18,2020-06-18,"Hi <@U010SGDUGN4>. For Tea, I guess we can subclassify. Black tea is most common in the North India (brewed). For Tastes, I personally agree with the suggestion. Last, in the case of ENO, I guess, the overall experience must not be similar to salty taste, but like a bit of bitter, carbo-gasy.

U010YNNS9BQ,_indiaa,2020,08,25,2020-08-25,"This is fantastically implemented. Great job people. The interface of choosing the item in one place is Nifty, the instructions and images are clear and suggestive. The final analysis is pretty and informative. Gives some sense of how did the test go on one quick glance. 

To reduce length, one suggestion is to skip the personal details form at the start. Instead, being the test directly. In the end, you can ask for registration and there ask them to enter the details. Only those who are motivated will do it, but we will still get general sense of smell of the population even though without metadata for some people.

To improve the conversion rate, you can say the report will be shown when you register. This bait approach will make more people fill these details since they want to know and have already finished doing the test. We can make many of the registration details optional. Only key aspects necessary. This way, we can also send daily or weekly reminders, on WhatsApp/sms/email. 

Also one question, if there a reason for visual scale? Is it to match gccr?  Another possible way is discrete 0, 1,2,3 scale with no middle point. No smell, some mild smell can't identify, mild smell but can identify, full smell. Something on those lines, since we don't really have great resolution of intensity based on memory. So no fence sitting value. Forced choice. 

There are a few super minor name label additions to make it more accessible. Barring that, this is a great job. I prefer this much more than gccr and is very pleasing to the eye.",message,
U010SGDUGN4,_indiaa,2020,08,26,2020-08-26,"Hi Pavan, thanks for your wonderful feedback. For scale, we have also received similar feedback that it is difficult to understand and the chances of randomly clicking somewhere on the scale are high. The idea was to keep it similar to GCCR so we could combine the data at some point. Most likely, we are going to change it. Thanks for your suggestions.",message,

U010YNNS9BQ,_indiaa,2020,08,27,2020-08-27,"If we have to stick to ten point scale, I would suggest a ten point radio button, with annotations on 1 and 10 of no smell and complete smell. Much easier than a slider for a subjective rating",message,
U010H6AKZH9,_indiaa,2020,09,21,2020-09-21,<!channel> Hi there!  I was asked to write about our work for our COVID-gyan site (<https://covid-gyan.in/>).  Could you take a look at what I have written about our consortium?  Let me know if you have any recommended changes before EOD tomorrow if you can!,message,
U010H6AKZH9,_indiaa,2020,09,21,2020-09-21,"@channel Here is the writeup:

There are already several studies from countries such as China, Italy, UK, Belgium, France, Spain and the US showing a connection between changes in smell and taste and SARS-CoV-2  (COVID-19) infection. However, the rate of occurrence for loss of smell and taste varies widely in these studies, possibly because they used different methods. In addition, there are many factors that can affect smell and taste such as other diseases, medicines, lifestyle, genetics, and environment, and these will also differ within and between countries. To make the picture even more complicated, there are also genetic variations in the COVID-19 viruses themselves in different regions, which could potentially change how they impact smell and taste.

To address these concerns, a group of more than 600 clinicians, neurobiologists, data scientists, cognitive scientists, sensory researchers, and technicians from more than 50 countries was formed to develop a common voluntary survey translated into local languages to compare the results across borders, find country-specific factors, and support policy decisions for India and other countries worldwide. The group is known as the “Global Consortium for Chemosensory Research”. We hope to determine if loss/change of smell or taste is a reliable symptom to indicate infection, and when and how the change or loss of sense occurs.

We are freely distributing the survey online at <https://gcchemosensr.org/> for anyone to take anywhere in the world. In India, we have translated it into Hindi, Tamil, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Gujarati, Punjabi, Bengali, and Urdu. It is essential that we get as many responses as possible in India to provide more reliable information on COVID-19 and its relation to loss of smell and taste. The survey will be up as long as needed. 

In the first 11 days after questionnaire launch, 4039 survey participants (2913 women, 1118 men, and 8 others, aged 19–79) diagnosed with COVID-19 showed a significantly reduced sense of smell, taste or chemethesis (sensations of burning, cooling, tingling while smelling or tasting) compared to before the disease. Importantly, perceived nasal obstruction (e.g. stuffy nose) did not account for loss. These effects were also similar between participants in the laboratory test and clinical assessment groups. These results were published in June in the Journal Chemical Senses (<https://doi.org/10.1093/chemse/bjaa041>), with several consortium members from India and throughout the world as authors.

With confidence that changes in smell, taste, and chemothesis did correlate with COVID-19 onset, we then proceeded with the survey, translated into 23 different languages. Results from the ongoing survey show that recent loss of smell is an excellent predictor of COVID-19 diagnosis across different countries. The preprint of these results can be found here (<https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.22.20157263v2>).

As there appears to be a solid case for assessing smell and taste, the Indian collaborators [Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (National Centre for Biological Sciences and TIFR-Hyderabad), Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology (IIIT), Delhi, Karunya Institute of Technology and Sciences, and the Council of Scientific &amp; Industrial Research (CSIR)-Central Scientific Instruments Organisation (CSIO)] have created a self-assessment test to help monitor change/loss of smell and taste. You can take the test here: <http://mapcorona.in/#/>.

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic requires healthcare providers, contact tracers, and ultimately local, state, and national governments to quickly and reliably assess an COVID-19 risk. Thus, reliable tools are needed to assess likelihood of COVID-19 and subsequent testing or other measures. Some symptoms such as fever or dry cough are less specific than severe olfactory loss. Thus, loss of smell is an important symptom to consider regarding COVID-19. As always, if you or someone you know is experiencing smell loss or any other symptom related to COVID-19 (<https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus#tab=tab_3>), please immediately consult a medical professional for diagnosis.",message,

1. Organize translations in groups - ideally in this specific language channel.

3. Do NOT shorten any of the text, particularly not the consent form. This can jeopardize our IRB approval.
4. Translations involve 3 steps: *a) translate to the target language, b) translate back to English and c) discuss discrepancies between a) and b) and agree on a final translation.* 
5. Submit the final translation (c) to me -  replace “LANGUAGE” with your language in English and tag me @[your name] for this.

It is good we moved the conversation here. Anyway, I think we should try to organize our comments for more efficient work. Comments to the main questionnaire should be sent to the <#C010TRGSCB0|test_questionnaire_draft1>. As I understood now the comments from <@U010J3SDZ28> were forwarded. It will be a decision of the questionnaire team which comments will be incorporated and which not. For this reason, we should now focus on the Italian version. We have to provide our *translation today*, so it is important that we work on this version - decide as a team what it is REALLY important to add/modify.

As I wrote by email and now <@U010GME5DU4> suggested, we also need to get informed for local IRB - especially if we want to modify the global questionnaire. I do not have this possibility, who can check this? <@U010HKEG2HW>? <@U010JNDUXS9>? <@U0107NCU7LK>?",message,

U010LJGGGGH,_italy,2020,05,23,2020-05-23,"Ciao a tutti,

Vi aggiorno brevemente io e poi magari <@U010JNDUXS9> <@U010HKT9NAH> <@U011B5CRP54> e <@U010V9B9K5H> integrano e aggiungono.
Come sapete ieri sera ci siamo incontrati per parlare del progetto da presentare e delle diverse idee che si vorrebbero includere. L’idea principale era quella di fare uno studio che sia un po’ una fotografia della situazione italiana. In questo senso ci sono state molte proposte/idee tra cui riporto (scrivo quelle che mi ricordo o che mi sono segnata):
-      Valutare se c’è una differenza regionale (o tra macro aree visto che i dati potrebbero non essere abbastanza omogenei tra regioni)
-      Valutare una eventuale differenza tra pazienti che sono stati sottoposti al tampone e i pazienti che hanno avuto solo una diagnosi clinica (e valutare quanti hanno avuto in Italia una diagnosi clinica)
-      Analizzare le domande aperte e i commenti sui sintomi
-      Analizzare la correlazione tra i diversi sintomi
-      Valutare se ci sono differenze di genere ed età (qui sono state rivolte diverse preoccupazioni sul fatto che il campione potrebbe avere già di per sé un bias: la maggior parte dei partecipanti infatti sembra essere composto da donne giovani)
-      Correlare i dati che abbiamo con i dati forniti dalla protezione civile
-      Comparare i dati italiani con i dati di altri paesi europei che hanno avuto una gestione diversa o una chiusura totale più tardiva
Poi abbiamo discusso con Valentina Parma e si è avanzata l’idea di investigare le risposte alle domande sul recupero delle funzionalità chemosensoriali che fino ad ora sono state omesse dalle precedenti analisi (o dalle proposte presentate fino ad ora per quel che ne sappiamo). Questa idea è basata sul fatto che quando è uscito il questionario nella versione italiana (ho controllato su Slack era il 10 Aprile), in Italia, rispetto agli altri paesi, l’epidemia era già in atto da più due mesi (il primo paziente è stato ricoverato il 18 febbraio). Quindi potremmo aver raccolto dati di persone che erano già in fase di recupero.
Si è anche parlato della possibilità di ricontattare i pazienti che hanno lasciato i loro contatti. In questo caso ci sono due vie: a) se si fa tramite GCCR allora si può usare l’etico di Penn State ma in questo caso (se ho capito bene) deve essere un progetto comune a tutto il consorzio, b) se invece abbiamo delle idee specifiche per il campione italiano dobbiamo richiedere una nuova approvazione etica al di fuori di Penn State e a quel punto Penn State può fornire questi dati. Valentina diceva che circa il 30% dei partecipanti ha lasciato il recapito.

Quindi messe insieme tutte queste idee, abbiamo chiuso il meeting con la proposta di presentare in realtà due progetti:
1.    Un progetto sull’analisi dei dati globali italiani in cui inserire l’analisi per regione, l’analisi alle domande aperte e la correlazione tra i diversi sintomi (mi sembra ci fossero anche altri aspetti ma non li trovo tra le mie note). Per questo si pensava di utilizzare il proposal su cui si è lavorato in questi giorni ma focalizzando meglio la parte delle ipotesi
2.    Un progetto sull’analisi dei dati sulla recovery che da un lato si focalizzi sui dati italiani per valutare se effettivamente in Italia era già iniziata questa fase e come si caratterizza (quali abilità vengono recuperate per prime, ecc) e da un lato fare un confronto con altri Paesi (si pensava di confrontare tutti quelli con >1000 dati raccolti). Per questo secondo progetto, se interessa, si dovrebbe fare un secondo proposal. Sto creando io un draft preliminare che condividerò spero entro stasera così che poi ci possiamo lavorare tutti.
Vi allego intanto il questionario che ho scaricato da GCCR001 così lo abbiamo tutti a portata di mano per riguardare quali domande ci sono sul recovery.",message,

Come avrete letto nel canale <#C01073JSVLZ|key_announcements> l'home test è quasi pronto e ci chiedono di prepararci alla traduzione. Il procedimento è lo stesso di quello usato per la traduzione del questionario. Vanno comunicati i due 'responsabili' della traduzione e della back translation, poi il lavoro si può organizzare in team (così come organizzato dai main translators) e ovviamente la traduzione potrà essere discussa ed approvata nel gruppo. <@U0107NCU7LK> si può occupare del lavoro della traduzione, c'è un volontario per coordinare la back translation?

For this purpose, you will find attached a document that you will have to translate. 4 people are enough to do this, and one of these four can be the “supervisor”. Or you can also decide to have 5 people and one of them is the supervisor. *Define who will be the translator 1, 2, 3, 4 and the supervisor in your team.* You will find in the excel sheet different panels: instructions, sheet1 and sheet2. Please read carefully the instructions before starting to work. If you have any
question just let me know. When the excel document is completed, tag me here <@U011Y9CCJ6S> and download the document so I can transmit it to the implementation team before Friday, end of the day.

If yes, then I will give it to the implementation team.

I looked at it and it seems very good. Only one column is red and it is because at the end, each of the translators should put ""Y"" in his corresponding column I, J, K, L or M if he approves the final version for each sentence. If everyone approved all the sentences, all the columns have Y in it and then the column N becomes green. Here we do not mind because this was just a test version. I just wanted to explain this to you. Maybe it was not clear enough in the instructions, what do you think about it? Feel free to say anything about that, it is why the test version was for.

I hope you are well. <@U010GN5UADR> and I are organizing an outreach activity for ISOT (August 3rd-August 7th) and we would like for this to be COVID-related and very international.

To achieve this goal, we ask for your help.

Our proposal is to create language virtual rooms in which for max 1 hour people can:

1. gain knowledge on what  smell, taste and chemesthesis are and how COVID can affect them. We are preparing an infographic that can be used across languages for that.

2.  experience  two demos that are included in the AChemS Education Corner website:
• Flavor is multisensory (jelly bean test) <https://achems.org/web/resources-education-activity-1.php>
• Chemosensory adaptation <https://achems.org/web/resources-education-activity-3.php>

3. ask questions about smell and taste.

We'd love to organize one of these sessions in Italian, which can be place at a friendly time for Italy.  Would any of you be willing to help out? And if not, would you be able to suggest someone who could?

Thank you in advance for considering,

As of now (May 1, 2020) the Japanese government and local governments do not include olfactory &amp; taste loss as symptoms of COVID-19. The Japanese government recommends the public to consult with the local consultation centers if they have (1) cold symptoms or a fever of 37.5°C or over for four days or more. and/or (2) have a strong feeling of weariness or shortness of breath.
Mass media started reporting about possible association between COVID-19 and smell &amp; taste loss since around 26th March 2020 (the oldest news article we could found was this date).
The Oto-Rhino-Laryngological Society of Japan issued a statement about smell &amp; taste disorder in association with COVID-19 on 30th March 2020 (“there are cases where patients experience olfaction and/or taste abnormality”), and revised the statement on April 2nd 2020 (“it was found that COVID-19 reduces smell and taste ability”).",message,

I have received a request (which is based on our response to the leading team in June)  from the leading team about translation. Here are the message and materials:
**********
Thanks for expressing your interest in translating the self-assessment tool. Here is the link to the working document for the translation <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17iJGamDCnAy30vOBLzyOFvi2K7ZQjBXP9nKnZXTD7VU/edit?usp=sharing>.
Please follow the instructions given in the instruction sheet to proceed the translation. In addition, please translate a separate information sheet (attached) and return in a word document.
***********
Since each translation process has to be done by different individuals, we will need following:
・Forward translator 1
・Forward translator 2
・Backward translator 1
・Backward translator 2
・Supervisor
・plus someone who translate ""information sheet""
------------
According to the instruction, having 2 translators for each step (forward and backward) is ideal, but not mandatory.

Do you mind telling me (or writing here) which role you could take?

※some of us had difficulties working on google sheet, so I chose to use excel. I will copy your comments to the google sheet afterwards. Sorry for any inconvenience.
※So far, I did following to the the ""final"" sheet,
●I copied the Forward translation 2 (which is back translated) to the ""Final"" column (N and O)
●Then, I applied some corrections based on ""back translation discrepancy"" commented by the supervisor.
Those I applied corrections are marked red in the column L and M, and marked as ""修正済み"" in column P.
※FYI, below is the conversation we had with the core translation team regarding rows 70, 87, 88:
-------------
Questions:
We have a question about the translation.

1)There are some smell items that are not popular (probably most people do not know) in Japan. Among them, we are especially concerned about follows for reasons shown in () :

Row number 87
”For example, cooling from Eucalyptus or stinging or burning from mustard.”
(Eucalyptus is not common in Japan, so it does not work as an example)
We could replace Eucalyptus with Menthol or Mint so that Japanese people can understand.

Row number 88
* Vicks Vaporub® or Camphor or Eucalyptus oil ""
(as there are not many choices)
Can we replace Vicks Vaporub® with other items such as, Mentholatum® that contain Eucalyptus oil and common in Japanese household?
Mentholatum® <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mentholatum>

Row number 70
There are several spices that Japanese would not know, but we think it is OK as there are many other choices.

Answers:

Row number 87
”For example, cooling from Eucalyptus or stinging or burning from mustard.”
(Eucalyptus is not common in Japan, so it does not work as an example)
We could replace Eucalyptus with Menthol or Mint so that Japanese people can understand.
*A: Yes it is ok to replace Eucalyptus with Menthol or Mint in the example*

Row number 88
* Vicks Vaporub® or Camphor or Eucalyptus oil ""
(as there are not many choices)
Can we replace Vicks Vaporub® with other items such as, Mentholatum® that contain Eucalyptus oil and common in Japanese household?

*A: Yes it is ok to replace Vicks Vaporub® with Mentholatum®*

Row number 70
There are several spices that Japanese would not know, but we think it is OK as there are many other choices.
*A: Please keep these spices as they were. We have included many spices / items to have something for everybody. If subjects don't know an item, they will probably not select it.*",message,

Here is a reply from the translation team to your question:
***
Thanks for pointing out the sentences that might confuse participants. After discussing with the team, our suggestion is not to edit the information sheet. Here I copied the direct message I got from <@U010KM0A4KG>: ""We kindly ask to participate weekly for 3 months. This is not the duration of the study. But people are free to do what they like. So please translate as is."".  I believe this means that we wish participants to do the test for a minimum of 3 months but they can do it shorter or longer as they like. Cheers.",message,

U010MD7FVQB,_japan,2020,10,04,2020-10-04,"Dear <@U010KBAMVKJ> 
CC <!channel>

We have checked the online version. Thank you very much for your help while our checking.
In addition to the language switching problem that <@U010UTDM4HE> , <@U0110HPM0HL> and <@U0115858CMT> reported (which, I hear that the translation team is working on now:pray:), we found some problems probablly caused by inappropriate edit codes.

1. *Attached, I send you a screen shot of the pages with problems. To correct some of the problems, I also updated the questionnaire in google sheet.*
<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17iJGamDCnAy30vOBLzyOFvi2K7ZQjBXP9nKnZXTD7VU/edit?usp=sharing>.

Cells with corrections are highlighted with yellow in the ""Final"" sheet, column N,
I also added comments ""Modified on 5th Oct. to correct format"" in the column P for those cells.
Would it be possible to reflect these changes?

*2. I could not figure out how to correct problems for the following 2 :*
(1) page 4 in the attachment. For the button ""go to previous page"":
we would like to change ""前の”　to  ”前へ”
(2) page 11 in the attachment. top part of the characters are gone.
However, this is readable, so if it is difficult to correct, please leave them as it is.

Please let me know if you have any questions.
Again, thank you so much for your help:pray::slightly_smiling_face:",message,

Additional investment for accelerated research programmes on corona
<https://www.nwo.nl/en/news-and-events/news/2020/04/additional-investment-for-accelerated-research-programmes-on-corona.html|https://www.nwo.nl/en/news-and-events/news/2020/04/additional-investment-for-accelerated-research-programmes-on-corona.html>

3 April 2020

Minister of Health, Welfare and Sport Hugo de Jonge informed the House of Representatives on Wednesday 1 April that the cabinet is allocating a total of €42 million for research on the most urgent corona-related research questions. It is estimated that these additional funds will enable some 80 to 100 research issues to be investigated. It is important that these resources are made available in a well-coordinated but also quick and simple manner. A substantial part of the €42 million will be awarded by ZonMw and NWO, who will work closely together to this end in research programming.

1. Fast incidental funding round for COVID-19 (‘first wave')
Right after the coronavirus was detected in the Netherlands, incidental funding was used for targeted and urgent research on ways of combating the COVID-19 pandemic. This was funded by the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport (€4 million) and ZonMw (€1 million); NWO has joined as well, making €1.5 million available.

The funding involves:

Medical research: monitoring recovering patients, the transmission of the virus to and from children, hospital epidemiology, the development of medication that can be used in the (very) short term, antibodies and virus evolution. Socio-scientific research proposals that examine the impact of social isolation and its consequences have also been prioritised. These projects have already been launched or will begin shortly. These studies are being coordinated by ZonMw.
Behavioural research: research on social distancing and its impact on the spread of the virus. This is being coordinated by the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM).
It is also possible to apply for a small financial compensation (€7,500 to €15,000) for creative solutions for practical (hospital) care. For example for medical devices or to help care and assistance providers give vulnerable groups the right care and assistance. ZonMw is doing its utmost to respond to applicants within a week to ensure that creative solutions can be put into practice as quickly as possible.

A total of €6.5 million has been made available by the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport, ZonMw and NWO for this initial research.

2. COVID-19 research programme to be launched shortly (‘second wave')
ZonMw and NWO are currently developing an additional research programme in close consultation with the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport and the field. This new programme will provide space for different types of research (action research, applied and fundamental research) on subjects similar to those in the accelerated incidental funding round, but which will also focus on the (broader social) consequences of the crisis and measures to be taken in the longer term.

The grants will be awarded in the near future. The entire programme will run until the end of 2024 at the latest, for monitoring and completion of all pathways.

A total of about €20 to 25 million has been made available for this type of research by NWO, ZonMw, the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport and the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science.

3. Fast-track data NWO research
To acquire data that can only be collected now, during the crisis, the NWO domains Social Sciences and Humanities, Science, and Applied and Engineering Sciences are developing a so-called ‘fast-track data' request. Researchers can apply for funding for research that requires real-time data acquisition on issues emerging as a result of the crisis, data that can help to manage the crisis, or that can increase the learning capacity of society during a pandemic.

To ensure that the data can be collected as quickly as possible, NWO is doing its utmost to give applicants the go/no go within one working week. Researchers will make data and an initial analysis of this data openly accessible as soon as possible. Medical and care-related subjects are excluded from this enquiry. The call is already open and can be found below (English version will be made available as soon as possible).

In total, NWO is making €1.5 million available for this call: each NWO domain is contributing €0.5 million.

Ik denk dat het een goed idee is om een lijst te maken met personen/gremia/instituten etc binnen Nederland waar wij de vragenlijst kunnen verspreiden. Op die manier krijgen we een zo groot mogelijk bereik en voorkomen we dat mensen de vragenlijst dubbelop krijgen (en dus irritatie opwekken). Ik heb niet zoveel ervaring met het opzetten van een google doc oid, maar dat lijkt mij het meest handig daarvoor, zodat iedereen het kan updaten en we per persoon zien we welke connecties heeft.  Ik heb al wel een kort xls lijstje gemaakt. Wie kan/wil dit omzetten?
Daarnaast wil ik een persbericht schrijven dat (vanuit WUR) vesrtuurd kan worden zodra de NL vertaling live is, zodat het verder in de media opgepikt en verspreid kan worden. Nog andere suggesties?

Enkele actiepunten:
• ik heb enkele namen toegevoegd van het Nederlandse deel van GCCR, maar dit lijstje is volgens mij niet volledig. <@U010HK2RMEU> kun jij dit lijstje aanvullen, of moet iedereen die op het persbericht wil staan dat even laten weten aan mij? 
• een aantal concepten zijn lastig te vertalen, zoals 'chemesthesis', 'open science', 'best practice', 'crowd sourcing' - die heb ik of uitgelegd, of in het Engels laten staan. sommige andere vertalingen kunnen mogelijk beter (zoals 'swab test'/'wattenstaafjestest'). mijn vraag is om suggesties te doen om de vertaling te verbeteren. 
• en het belangrijkste: wanneer gaan we dit verspreiden - zsm met een link naar de arxiv versie (het persbericht moet dan nog aangepast worden) of wachten tot het artikel daadwerkelijk is gepubliceerd in CS?

U0168KEMX0A,_nigeria,2020,07,16,2020-07-16,Thanks dear Coralie. I'll be glad to have the briefing on your procedures as I did not seem to receive any previously.,message,
U011Y9CCJ6S,_nigeria,2020,07,16,2020-07-16,"Okay. So here are some explanations. I am a coordinator, so I take in charge the communication between the translation team (you) and the implementation team (the team that implement the translation online).

Olagunju had to go through all these steps:
He had to translate four documents from english to Yoruba. He had to respect the structure and use the *exact same formatting* (bold, underlined...). This was important to help the implementation team so they can identify what goes where later in the survey. Another recommendation was also to *NOT shorten any of the text, particularly not the consent form.* This could jeopardize the IRB (ethics) approval.

The translations involves 3 steps: a) translate from English to the target language, b) translate back to English and c) discuss discrepancies between a) and b) and agree on a final translation. In this purpose, it is better to work in a group so one can do the step a), another one the step b), and both can discuss, adapt and vote for the version c). However, until now, Olagunju was alone to do this work so he did all the steps by himself. Then, he submitted the final translation (c) to me on this channel. I transmitted it to the implementation team and they did an online test version. That is is test version that you should try (through the link I copied pasted earlier) and give me a feedback, so I can tell them if there are modifications to do. Is it clearer?",message,
U0168KEMX0A,_nigeria,2020,07,16,2020-07-16,"Yes it's clearer now. Thank you. It's actually that final version he submitted that I chose for further modification to cater for better readability and comprehension by the prospective reader. 

The following are thus my few inquiries as I work towards turning in the edited document,

1. What version should I title it? C-II or another A,B and C?
2. Should I track the changes I make using word or simply highlight or none?
3. I noticed that the error messages as earlier translated weren't incorporated yet. Are they being  left out consciously?

Thanks again",message,
U0168KEMX0A,_nigeria,2020,07,16,2020-07-16,4. Could you also expatiate kindly what is meant by not to shorten any of the texts?,message,
U011Y9CCJ6S,_nigeria,2020,07,16,2020-07-16,"Ok Royhaan, very good. So if you want to improve the main translation,you should be sure that Olagunju agrees on your modifications. If not, you should both find a compromise. Then, you can download the document on this channel and tag me.
1. The name can be C_V2.
2. You should track the changes for Olagunju, then discuss both of you about it; and then provide here the version on which you both agreed with the modifications highlighted in yellow for example, so it is easier for the implementation team. 
3. I think the error messages were not incorporated in the online test survey because the implementation team did not have this document for the moment. I will transmit it to them. It is a quite new document, that is why it was not done for the moment. Thank you for being meticulous :slightly_smiling_face: 
4. ""Not shorten any of the text"" means that every sentence should be translated, even if sometimes you have the impression that it is superfluous, excessive or repetitive :slightly_smiling_face: Is it clearer?",message,

1. Instances of omitted, misplaced or excess tonal marks and punctuations were  highlighted in purple  
2. It may be easier for the implementation team to copy some of the tedious characters from this attached word document if the typing of such with keyboards become daunting
3. There were two instances where english versions of questions were yet to be replaced with their yoruba translations as contained in the word document. These were also highlighted in purple.
4. The phrase ""Loading...Please wait"" may be translated as ""Ó ńbọ̀... Jọ̀wọ́ ṣe sùúrù""
5. Just to mention that it would be nice if there were possibility of subjects/volunteers returning to previous pages during the survey, should they desire to edit their previous responses? Otherwise, it's just great.

1. We have prepared three documents that need translating (Translation, Translation responses and Error codes). Respect their structure and use the *exact same formatting* for your final translation. This helps us identify what goes where later in the survey. Remember: we do not speak your language!
2. Do *NOT shorten any of the text, particularly not the consent form.* This can jeopardize our IRB approval.
3. Translations involve 3 steps: a) translate to the target language, b) translate back to English and c) discuss discrepancies between a) and b) and agree on a final translation. 
4. Submit the final translation (c) to me on this channel -  replace “LANGUAGE” with your language in English and tag me <@U011Y9CCJ6S> for this.

The short version is that the changes you are insisting on will require you to get your own IRB, as changing the contact PI with make the study _not_ covered by my IRB. Also, just to clarify, right now each country is NOT getting a local IRB to sign off before translations are launched.

That is, languages are not countries. For example, we might choose to launch a Portuguese version to cover the Portuguese speaking community in eastern Massachusetts and Rhode Island in the USA. If Portuguese speakers in other countries found the URL online (say on twitter for example) they would still be able to complete the study, as the current protocol covers global deployment via traditional media, social media, and word of mouth.

In short, it seems like you might confusing two different issues: the actual translation, versus the local ability to publicize and promote the global version of the study.",message,

I hope you are well. <@U010GN5UADR> and I are organizing an outreach activity for ISOT (August 3rd-August 7th) and we would like for this to be COVID-related and very international.

To achieve this goal, we ask for your help.

Our proposal is to create language virtual rooms in which for max 1 hour people can:

1. gain knowledge on what  smell, taste and chemesthesis are and how COVID can affect them. We are preparing an infographic that can be used across languages for that.

2.  experience  two demos that are included in the AChemS Education Corner website:
• Flavor is multisensory (jelly bean test) <https://achems.org/web/resources-education-activity-1.php>
• Chemosensory adaptation <https://achems.org/web/resources-education-activity-3.php>

3. ask questions about smell and taste.

We'd love to organize one of these sessions in Portuguese, which can be place at a friendly time for Brazil or Portugal.  Would any of you be willing to help out? And if not, would you be able to suggest someone who could?

Thank you in advance for considering,

U010NCMR6QL,_spain,2020,04,22,2020-04-22,"<@U011NF2KANS> hey - I think that so far in many people’s mind the country head = the one designated for the translations, which obviously poses a problem for Spanish because many countries share the language. We have a similar glitch with Switzerland as we share languages with our immediate neighbors, thus until recently there was no official coordinator either. I’m not even sure of who was leading the translation effort as did not participate for Spanish unfortunately, so apologies for my ignorance! However, given that we are now in the survey dissemination phase, and that strategies might vary slightly according to countries (e.g. clearly the press/government/healthcare organs will be different people but we can still use Spanish articles from other countries to convey the message), I would thus second your suggestion that for “Spain” matters, there should be a dedicated person coordinating these efforts. It would also make the collaboration accross spanish speaking countries easier in <#C012XRL3048|_spanish_speaking_countries>. To your other question, I am not aware of who is the current country lead for Spain, but you could check by asking in <#C010G3PTSQZ|country_leaders> or #_random.

Cuando tenga mas tiempo la semana que viene, he pensado en hacer lo siguiente, inspirado por las estrategias de Finlandia + Francia + Italia :
1) contactar a los ORL en los mayores hospitales del pais (Colombia)  porque quiero en prioridad movilizar a los expertos locales
2) centros de investigacion universitaria en psicologia experimental / biologia  /medicina. No encontre muchos laboratorios  en ‘chemosensory’, claro que si conocen a gente por favor compartan :slightly_smiling_face: .
3) Gobierno, en particular ministerio de las ciencias . Eso lo hicieron en Francia y permitio activar una red de contactos immensa, vale la pena intentar
4) Periodicos/medios de comunicacion, idealmente sostenidos por expertos locales, y hablando de la posicion de gobiernos latinoamericanos en el asunto p. ej.  perdida olfato oficialmente parte de los simptomas COVID 19 en Chile
5) En Italia pusieron anuncios en las farmacias locales - lo veo dificil en nuestro caso - y tambien llamaron a ‘influencers’ y ‘bloggers’ que ayudaron a difundir el mensaja. Esa estrategia fue muy util en Suiza, porque mucha gente no tomaba las reglas en serio, hizo falta la intervencion de humoristas para convercerlos de quedarse en casa!

Vi en <#C01073JSVLZ|key_announcements> que piden subir el video subtitulado y los subtítulos (e.g., .vtt) a este Drive <https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qSCXRPzZwPlLct9yFqW5UMT3bXMWEIRa>
Piden nombrarlo siguiendo esta estructura: ¨LANGUAGE_GCCRvideo1"", por tanto sería ¨SPANISH_GCCRvideo1"".
No obstante, si descargas el video verás que es independiente de los subs, por tanto el archivo de video es idéntico al original (sin los subs).
Para combinar los archivos de video y los subs usé HandBreak y ese es el archivo que subí al Drive para la versión en Farsi.
En resumen, al Drive subí una carpeta titulada ¨FARSI_GCCRvideo1"" que contiene: 1) el video combinad con los subs (.mp4), 2) los subs aparte (.vtt) y 3) un .txt con el link del video en YT.
Si te parece bien, puedo hacer lo mismo para la versión en Español, pero necesitaría que me enviaras los subs en formato .srt que puedes obtener como se muestra en la imagen adjunta.

La recogida de los datos se llevó a cabo entre las fechas 27 de abril y 11 de mayo de 2020. En abril había confinamiento estricto, que progresivamente se fue levantando. Sin embargo, no recuerdo exactamente cuándo empezamos a poder salir a calle para actividades que no fueran ir a comprar comida o hacer ejercicio. Al principio del confinamiento, sólo podíamos salir a comprar víveres y a trabajar si no podías trabajar desde casa y si no eras trbajador/a esencial (ámbito sanitario, de la seguridad o farmacéutico). Después, nos dejaron salir, además, para hacer ejercicio. Después, además, para reunirnos con unos pocos familiares. A partir del 21 de junio, hemos podido viajar entre ciudades.

A version b of the questionnaire that specifically targets people without formal diagnosis could be an option. It would be the same as the original but with slight modification.

I have a few journalists at SVT, SR, DN and Expressen that often contacts me with odor/taste questions so I can ask them if they can promote this once it is online. I haven't asked them to promote anything from us in the past so I think that they will be OK to do something about it due to the public health benefit.

The implementation of translation in the Compusense platform will be done by the Penn State team, in batches. Based on considerations regarding: 
&gt; a) the population size of speakers per language,
&gt; b) the ability to reach the six continents represented in the GCCR,
&gt; c) the number of reported cases of COVID-19,
&gt; d) the presence of a country/language leader (organize the translation and translate the answers to the open questions back to English),
&gt; e) the reporting on the translation/back translation procedures,
&gt; f) the default languages available in Compusense
&gt; g) the possibility to share the GCCR core questionnaire link without the need for additional IRB
the leadership team selected six languages to go live in the first batch. Additional languages will be added according to the criteria above, as resources and interest allow. 

The initial languages are:
English (North America, parts of EU, New Zealand/Australia, Africa)
Spanish (Spain, part of Central and South America)
French (France, Canada, Africa)
Italian
German
Turkish

Languages, including Hindi, Persian, Arabic and more are planned next.",message,

Thank you very much for this initiative!  I will be the language coordinator that takes in charge the communication with the implementation team. There are two specific documents to translate, an excel document for the selfcheck tool itself, and an information word document.

The information document can be translated by one person only, as long as it is understandable by at least another people from this channel. Concerning the excel document, it is different, there is a very specific procedure that is explained in the first sheet ""Instructions"". <@U010Z6MG2AH> will be the supervisor for the translation. <@U0107KBFZ7V> and <@U010JKQMV0U> will be the forward translators (English to Swedish). <@U010PKPHTBM> and <@U010Z6MG2AH> will be the two back translators (Swedish to English). Please read carefully the instructions before starting to work. If you have any questions, just let me know. When the documents are completed, tag me here so I can transmit the information to the implementation team.

Important:
• some characters in red in the excel document have to stay exactly the same in the translation
• do not shorten or simplify the sentences
• some English sentences are the same than in the survey on which you already worked before. Thus, you need to be sure that they will be translated exactly in the same way than in the survey
Here are the links:

U010P54UNLD,_turkey,2020,03,27,2020-03-27,"Maria, I looked at the Turkish version of the Questionnaire. It needs work on it but it would be a replication of my version of it. I do recommend you, instead of doubling the same work, please use my version of it. You can change/edit/modify it. Feel free. Unfortunately, with this translation, it may cause lots of bias and misunderstanding... The translation should consider the local people's sensitivity and educational level and understanding.  We do not know who is going to read and answer it... Let us make universal coding of language which any person, regardless, can understand and give right and full answer",message,
U010KDF9AVD,_turkey,2020,03,27,2020-03-27,"Thanks! This is a very good point and others have brought this up too. One problem is that unless all other languages also say ""sourness like lemon"" (just an example) we cannot change such things because then it is a different question and the Turkish data cannot be combined with all the other data. Unfortunately as soon as we mention lemon we get the potential misunderstanding of retronasal olfaction.

So this is an example of a compromise.  It is not perfect, but some of the cultural (mis)interpretations will get flushed out simply by the virtue of the huge numbers from other cultures (that will probably have different misunderstandings). Of course if they change the wording on the questionnaire globally, we will too, because the value of a global effort is greater at this point in time. I do completely understand and appreciate your point and we'll see if these things get adjusted in the global one. :slightly_smiling_face:

I will send you a next version too, because I think there will still be some small changes and then you will be up to date on whether these requests have or have not been incoroporated.

I'm not actively working on the contents of the questionnaire project myself, but just leading the translation ot Turkish of it. If you have other specific concerns, you can bring them up on <#C010KLR163G|covid-19questionnaire>. Not much time is left on that though, because this soon needs to be submitted to the IRB.

Note that the hometest will do much better at these things, which will be the next project, see the channel <#C010KLR8YRL|covid-19hometest>.",message,

U010KDF9AVD,_turkey,2020,05,14,2020-05-14,"Dear all,
 
*Concerning the first paper:* 
Please find a translation for the press release attached. You can just fill in the information for you and your institution and then give it to your University news office. Note that while the questionnaire was available in Turkish, there were just a few respondents and those were from Turkish speaking people not in Turkey. Thank you Elif, Huseyin, Nur and Lina! <@U010P54UNLD> do you want to use this document as a basis to reach out to Anadolu press like you did before?
 
*Concerning the second paper:* 
A pre-registration (predictions and analysis plan) has been submitted, and the analyses will be done over the next couple of days. The GCCR002 manuscript will address the main research question for which the GCCR questionnaire was designed: to assess changes in chemosensory function in participants with COVID-19 versus those with other respiratory illnesses. There will be an authorship agreement plan going out on Friday and you will be asked to sign up and contribute next week. I will keep you up to date over email, but pay attention to slack (the channel <#C01073JSVLZ|key_announcements>) yourself too. The authorship agreement will be at least somewhat different than the first one, so it may be different to qualify for authorship this time, but I’m not sure how it’s going to work out yet. Ask me if you are eager to contribute and become an author and I'll take a look and find an opportunity for you.
 
There will be a video-conference consortium meeting on Monday May 18 at 20.00 Turkish time. On the agenda for this meeting: i) take a moment to cherish the submission of GCCR001 and discuss its results; ii) discuss about GCCR002; iii) review the new study proposal mechanisms together. If you are interested, but cannot attend, there will be a recording available to watch later.
 
Thank you for your help with spreading the questionnaire! We are around 150 responses now. Getting press releases out will help, so please spread those at your universities.

We are now at *326 responses to the global survey* and 279 on the Turkey-only survey.

Of course we just had the Bayram, but there are still cases in Turkey and those will probably continue, so I would also like to ask for your continued efforts in helping get participation in the questionnaire. There are various ways we can do this:

1. By posting on your own social media account. You can refer to my twitter account for examples of tweets:  <https://twitter.com/margaveldhuizen>
2. By asking people you know with high social media follower counts to share or retweet your message
3. To ask your Universities press office to adapt and publish our press release. You can be featured as a member of GCCR in this. Of course I’m also willing to talk to your press office if that helps.
4. Ask  officials at a local health care provider, for example, a doctor’s clinic, hospital or pharmacy  to post the attached flyer.
*I also want to ask each of you to go to a local or national news paper webpage and find the persons responsible for health and science news. Give them a phone call. Tell them about the study (you can use the press release) and ask them to do an article on smell loss and COVID-19.*
In many countries taste or smell loss are now considered symptoms and I think it is incredibly important that we ask attention to this issue in Turkey.

I cannot do this on my own, because I don’t speak Turkish well enough. I need YOUR help.

The GCCR has received a donation in the form of a video: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53GEN4bHmm4&amp;feature=youtu.be>

 I would like to ask for volunteers to translate and add subtitles with the following instructions (see attached). <https://gccr-mql6351.slack.com/files/U010GME5DU4/F0143HDQ0GN/gccr_add_merge_subtitles.doc>

Out of 85 posts from members, 95% mentioned anosmia/smell-loss (which is not really surprising, considering it is a group for this!). Then, 65% described taste-loss (but i think a lot find it hard to discriminate smell and taste). 64 % described both smell and taste-loss. 7% of posts had a burning sensation/pain, described as being in the region of the nose, eye or eye brow region. Lastly, 5% of posts reported parosmia, which is more phantosmia when they are describing 'burning wire', 'hot air' smells (though Chrissi and many others think parosmia and phantosmia may have a lot in common). These are just observational. I need to properly check, but Chrissi noticed that most of the members are 'prime of life' rather than elderly, as opposed to the Anosmia Support group which has older sufferers",message,

If this was a survey for an engaged group of established smell and taste sufferers then the response rate would be higher. It needs PPI input. Is there a pdf I can forward to our panel? I don’t think the questions about smoking and nasal sensitivity add anything- it’s the fact that a sudden change in smell has occurred. I’ve done plenty of questionnaire studies and have seen that people without a chronic disease are little interested in filling out such detail unless there’s a financial reward.

2. Cultural translations: allergies - hay fever or food allergies? US/UK difference

3. Have you been diagnosed - no options of ‘No, but think I have from symptoms. Do you have Covid-19? Maybe, not sure.

3. Symptoms - tiredness , fatigue? Pretty common but missing from the list. Was tightness in the chest there?

4. What medications have you received?  Does this mean prescribed? Or taken by self-medication. Cough mixture, paracetamol, etc.

Here's the proposal for <@U010MSNP3FH> <@U010H1EC3J8> and the Steering Committee. It builds on a suggestion by <@U01062RS9R9> yesterday. Divide the questionnaire into 2 parts. First part required questions. Second part, additional questions (optional). It could say, If you have time to give us more information please answer the following questions. Answering is optional. This way, we could have the key questions - short list of the questions that are potentially most illuminating to us, to the clinicians, and for all other specialisms and interests covered, the more responses to the Additional (optional) questions the better. Compuserve is nicely set up and it's functionality means there isn't a long look ahead at lost and lots of questions, One could finish after the required questions and submit. This has the advantage that IF we could agree what was required (short number of key questions from the survey) then it would be universal that every respondent in the whole international roll out would answer the same questions. For the additional questions the same would be true but they are no compulsory. Theme and variation, if you like. Or CORE and periphery. This is modest proposal and if accepted might bring everyone on board. I've seen plenty of feed back in the Google doc about survey being too long. So if this were accepted the quick fire discussions could try to establish pretty quickly what goes sin the CORE - with particular relevance to what ENT-UK have been saying about loss of smell being a potential marker for C19. Focusing on this could be really helpful and potentially very important. As <@U010L37MR1D> wrote in The Conversation: ""As the pandemic peaks around the globe, we expect people reporting smell loss will increase in number. Smell loss as a first warning sign could be important in further preventing the spread.""  It's this information we need to ensure we capture.",message,

Besides,  what so many people are reporting on social media, in the press and as seen by clinicians, it's the sudden, complete loss of smell. Those are the people we most want to reach and who would have a personal interest in completing a survey like this one. It will be a surprise to them as it is to so many UK clinicians to see no obvious way to report it. Questions about intensity shifts, changes in quality, Phantosmia will seen very far from what such vast numbers of people have noticed. Plus, there is a clinical reason for capturing this worldwide, as the KCL London study captured it for the UK, to move policy on declaring it as connected symptom so advice goes out to stop this with sudden anosmia going into care home, helping the elderly and other vulnerable populations. We also want a sea about who has this in isolation and who has it with others symptoms. UK group keen to extend Q if we need to ask a question about it. Better if we didn't have to. Thanks",message,

U010LKHD4RK,_uk,2020,04,13,2020-04-13,"Colleagues, the GCCR survey as it stands has a window of having symptoms in last 2 weeks to report. Outside that window you exit the survey, so lots of these whose reports would be valuable to us are not included in Italy, Spain, the UK and beyond. We have an option, granted at the outset, of running the survey with additional questions of our own given we seek local Ethics approval. Having started this process already, we are very close to having Ethics approval from University of London. I take it we might want to ask additional questions about people who have now had smell restored, to know if it was accompanied by other symptoms, to know if smell loss was sudden, how long loss of smell lasted and whether it came back all at once or bit by bit. We can get at that and many of you as clinicians want to know about duration. So, with your permission I will press on.  I have been asking <@U010MSNP3FH> if he can clarify the nature of any agreement Penn have with Compusense, about data handling, which our Research Ethics Committee wants to hear about.

Dear Nicola
It was good talking with you about the Current Biology lemur paper. I’m also involved as a scientist volunteer on the international Global Consortium of Chemosensory Researchers (GCCR, <http://gcchemosensr.org/> ) studying the effects of COVID-19 on the sense of smell. The leadership team includes Prof John Hayes at Penn State University, who I think you already know. The consortium brings together more than 600 researchers, clinicians and patient advocates from over 50 countries.

I’m writing to say that we are still seeking participants from the general public to fill in a short (10 mins) online survey about their sense of smell in relation to recent rapid onset smell loss associated with COVID-19, even in the absence of other symptoms. You may remember that ENT professionals in the UK <https://www.entuk.org/sites/default/files/files/Loss%20of%20sense%20of%20smell%20as%20marker%20of%20COVID.pdf|reported> this as a potential early symptom. The CDC, USA is now including this among their potential symptoms.

The GCCR will use the data collected in a worldwide survey to unravel how the virus is transmitted and how to prevent its spread. The survey has being translated into more than 24 languages, available online to individuals and clinicians on the GCCR website: <http://gcchemosensr.org/>.  The project has been ethically approved for international use and it is GDPR compliant.

We’d be really pleased if you could publicise the project and encourage people to take the survey. Chrissi Kelly ( <mailto:chris@abscent.org|chris@abscent.org> ), founder of AbScent and one of the GCCR leadership team, would be happy to give you more details and be interviewed (I’ve cc’d her in this email). UK clinicians are also involved and we could put you in touch with them, along with others such as Prof Barry Smith, UK lead.

Best wishes

U011FK8C4P8,_uk,2020,04,29,2020-04-29,"Two questions:  at the Monell Centre discussion on patient involvement in research around smell loss yesterday, Edmund Pribitkin mentioned his hunch that smell  loss with covid-19 may be a self defence mechanism against more severe brain injury. Just today I note a new article from research in hospitals in San Diego that concludes  'Normosmia is an independent predictor of admission in Covid-19 cases. Smell loss in Covid-19 may associate with a milder clinical course'.  <https://europepmc.org/article/med/32329222>.  Is this something that is coming up",message,
U011FK8C4P8,_uk,2020,04,29,2020-04-29,Second: Another issue that came up yesterday was that there is no 'insurance code' for sensory testing in the US and this has been a problem for gathering information on sensory issues. I wondered if the new symptom listing of anosmia by the CDC would have any impact here.  I wondered if this is something that people have already thought about and how this might be challenged in the US?,message,
U010H1EC3J8,_uk,2020,04,29,2020-04-29,"Thanks for these comments, Duika. Regarding the relationship between normosmia, preexisting pv/pi smell disorders and COVID-19, the Weizmann has a new short survey (just a couple of questions) that it seeking to drill down into this question. Lior Gorodisky, who works with Noam S (who is a member of the GCCR but not active) has asked to post this in the AbScent FB group.
As for no insurance code in the US, this is an issue. As we move forward toward the establishment of a  Priority Setting Partnership with the James Lind Alliance <@U010N34GLU8>, this is the sort of issue we can hope to tackle. Yesterday’s conference at Monell on the relationship between patients and researchers set some great priorities for the next phase.",message,

King's College Symptom Tracking team are also sharing data, and PHE are doing their own research interviewing COVID19 patients, which has also confirmed high rates. They accept that it is common - they are more hesitant about what value it adds to add it to the symptom list, and how infectious patients with isolated new onset smell and taste dysfunction might be. So, to their credit they are doing some work on that but will hopefully get a decision this week. I think they have felt it less relevant while we are in lockdown, and the general public seem really onboard with self-isolating for anosmia anyway. However, it becomes very relevant as we ease restrictions.",message,

U010LKHD4RK,_uk,2020,04,29,2020-04-29,"Yes, as you say, Claire,  it will be crucial when we ease restrictions. We've seen cases of people with sudden loss of smell and 21 days later they've tested positive for the virus. The issue of not knowing how infectious asymptomatic carriers with smell loss is erring on the risky side. Front-line staff in the NHS and elsewhere could be turning up for work - many are - with just smell loss, and getting close to vulnerable people, and still shedding.  Also, by not including it in the symptoms, many people are not tested who have coronavirus: you are only tested if you have symptoms, since this is not a symptom no testing, so we don't know. This is a miss on data gathering, and now the capacity is there, as we keep hearing, they could include it and test people.. We don't know how many of the public have contracted Covid-19 and inclusion could help us be more accurate. Colleagues and I had a letter on this in the BMJ: <https://www.bmj.com/content/368/bmj.m1202/rr-1> and various colleagues of yours joined to write a letter to the Lancet, which they sat on for a while but have remained cautious. I know Tim Spector was showing his data to Jonathan Van tam, but so far without him biting. The evidence will be pretty clear in the GCCR ms that has just been finalised. Big N. So maybe we can join France, Argentina, Brazil, and the CDC in the US and include it as symptom. Wishing you well in persuading them to look again.",message,

Rather nicely captures what we are seeing again and again: ""On another topic, the sense of smell is back, but still not as sharp as it was. I’m still getting pressure at the top of my nose, and an odd clicking from time to time (never had this before!). Fatigue is still a bit of a nightmare – fine for a couple of days, and then bang…. Cough is gone completely and breathing on my runs is now back to normal and pace getting back up there too (thank goodness!). It’s now week 5 since the first symptoms. Fatigue and aches came first (a bit like the onset of a cold), then pain in the nose, and headache behind the eyes, then smell loss, then very dry cough and bad fatigue, then trouble breathing on runs (but fine otherwise). My cousin, who is a paramedic, had exactly the same symptoms in exactly the same order, and has tested positive. So pretty sure you were right from the early loss of smell stage – I think I’ve had it…! Good job I followed your advice (and not the Gvts – my cough came 1 week after the smell loss) and isolated at that point to stop any further damage…!""",message,

A while back we thought of replying to the UUK call on behalf of Government for proposals to help with testing and we wanted to repurpose our Lancet letter with the suggestion of a home smell test. I registered online but proposals can only be submitted under headings from a pull down menu including: swap use, RNA testing, etc. So we did not submit anything. The letter is ready to go and one option we considered was sending our information to the Royal Society's panel of experts. However, we may not need to. Following the WHO inclusion of anosmia as a symptom is expected that CMOs and CSOs will confirm it at their Thursday meeting to review new evidence, and <@U0132UCMKQQ> who has her ear very close to the ground expects this too.

They have some really great data - you can find a pre-pring of some on <http://MEdRxIv.org|MEdRxIv.org> - look at Menni et al. I have been involved with the PHE team feeding in other evidence since early April. They also have access to a whole wealth of extra data that isn't yet published, undertaken by researchers directly linked to PHE - it's quite impressive how much has gone on behind the scenes, even if the decision making has been disappointingly slow. There is no doubt that there is sufficient evidence available to them to recognise anosmia - I think its been much more of a problem in getting the discussions prioritised above other things - such as wearing masks .

And yes, Nicola, we reached out to him early and he was originally a signatory to our letter to the Lancet but decided to come off and work behind the scenes when he was asked to show his data to NERVTAG. BTW, we saw this Tweet from Richard Horton (editor of the Lancet) yesterday  'A proposal, actually a plea, from several doctors on the frontline of Covid-19: Those with new loss of smell should be advised to self-isolate and be tested. This simple manoeuvre could save lives'. Yes, something that Claire and Nirmal Kumar were saying clearly in March. The water is building behind the dam. It won't be long now.",message,
U0132UCMKQQ,_uk,2020,05,07,2020-05-07,"It has been quite helpful that several of the senior PHE advisors all lost their sense of smell as part of otherwise quite paucisymptomatic infection and admitted that they would not have otherwise been tested or diagnosed.... Fortunately most hospitals and other workplaces (but, sadly  not all) have also taken the message on board and done the same - so the very collective effort of publicising the importance of sense of smell has been recognised by health care workers and the general public regardless of the lack of recognition from the government. Here is a extract of an email (one of many hundreds!)  shared with permission, that shows the impact of what we are all working for;                                                                “Thank you for publishing your concerns regarding post viral anosmia.  
My son is 23 years old. He is a respiratory physio in hospital, working with COVID-19 on the wards and in ICU. He had a bit of a cold last Sunday/Monday, which he put down to hayfever, so took antihistamine.  On Tuesday those symptoms had gone, but he had a profound loss of taste and smell. This rang alarm bells, so he rang 111 in order to try and get a test as he works for the NHS. He was told to carry on as normal 'as he doesn’t have any COVID-19 symptoms’. He immediately called his boss at the hospital who arranged a test, which is positive. He has not felt at all unwell since and at no point would his symptoms have prevented him from working. His sense of taste is slowly returning, but smell is still absent.
5 of us live in our family home. In addition to my son working in hospital with elderly patients, my daughter is a children’s ICU nurse.  I am a Podiatrist, seeing only a tiny number of patients at the moment, all of whom fall into vulnerable groups. 
I am grateful to you for formally raising this issue. In our family alone, you have helped us to prevent the spread of this virus to some of the most vulnerable patients we all see.”",message,

It's reassuring to know that the collective effort to get word out and so many of your colleagues in the NHS taking up the cause has led to preventative actions. Vital, too, that word has gone to care homes. I worry that the volunteers helping those sheltering and other vulnerable populations may not know that smell loss could be part of paucisymptomatic infection. That's why a Gov decision would help.

I think the distortion question should be separate – with the comment box – because it could apply to all of them, then the question is a simple choice one out of three for smell, and yes/no for distortion.

The taste question is too complicated, too long, doesn’t fit on one page and had a “bar” in the middle of it. I really think this needs to be split into 2 or 3 questions. One on taste (sweet salty etc), one on chemesthesis (whatever we call it), and one on distortions, So answers 1&amp;2 go together, 4&amp;5 go together and 3&amp;6 go together.

Its not quite clear if you want to capture only patients with loss of senses of smell or taste, or to include those with  other symptoms. It would be good to make it really clear at the beginning. Also its a shame to repeat the question on do you currently have possible symptoms on COVID 19 at the beginning and at the end - you could combine the 3 different questions into the checklist of symptoms (which should include nasal obstruction) and have 2 columns - one for have currently, and another for have had recently.

In Q.13 we can add another box for 'My nose was blocked up'. when we ask them for their range of symptoms in Q21. that's what you skip to if you have no others smell or taste symptoms, that's why it is there and separate.

*Making human chemosensory research more reproducible: learning from the renaissance in psychology*
 Speaker: Tristram Wyatt 
*Abstract:*  Research on the human sense of smell often explores subtle effects but with small-scale experiments: across the rest of psychology, typically only 50-70 % of small-scale experiments can be replicated. Human chemosensory research would benefit from adopting the proposals made by psychologists to enable better, more reliable science, with an emphasis on enhancing reproducibility. Key tools are study pre-registration and/or Registered Reports which will also reduce publication bias. These approaches are being used by the new Global Consortium for Chemosensory Research (GCCR). To illustrate the problems and some solutions, I will use the story of the “putative human pheromones” androstadienone and estratetraenol which, despite never having been shown to be pheromones, have been the subject of some 60 studies claiming ‘significant’ positive results.

It will be signed by both presidents and she would like me to sign. I thin k it would be good to sign as UK lead for GCCR and so I would like all of you to let me know if you approve the letter. It is here, below. Many thanks!",message,
U010LKHD4RK,_uk,2020,06,08,2020-06-08,"Joint BRS/ENT-UK Letter (with UK Group, AbScent and Fifth Sense) Having been the first to highlight that the prevalence of sudden onset loss of sense of smell (anosmia) is a highly prevalent symptom of COVID-19 infection1,2, and having campaigned to achieve official recognition of the importance of anosmia as a marker of infection, we were delighted when Public Health England  changed their case definition of Covid-19 on the 18th May, and finally included loss of smell and taste among the officially recognised symptoms.

The wide-spread recognition of the importance of sudden smell loss has grown, but with this recognition have come calls from some quarters to introduce smell tests as a screening tool in certain settings, for example at airports and shopping centres, with the intention of denying access to those identified as having lost their sense of smell (Telegraph, 30th May and Lancet, June 4th 3). We would urge caution in adopting any such measure. Although the sudden onset of smell loss has a high likelihood of predicting a positive test for COVID-19  while the prevalence of the disease remains high, population estimates suggest that 19.1% of adults suffer from a pre-existing diminished sense of smell, a figure that rises to 80% in patients over the age of 75(4). [fn.? This closely reflects the 21.7% reporting loss of sense of smell in patients who tested negative for COVID-19 in the COVID Symptom Study(5)]. More significantly, for patients who have developed anosmia as a result of COVID-19 infection, chemosensory loss persists for 8 weeks in approximately 10% of cases [fn. data submitted for publication from 3 independent studies], but this does not reflect how infectious they are to others and whether they have viral clearance. Self-reported recovery rates of 5 days, reported by Menni et al (3), will not be matched by the results of psychophysical smell tests at airports and shopping centres. [fn. Studies using psychophysical testing for olfactory dysfunction in COVID-19 infection have shown that self-reported anosmia will likely underestimate the prevalence of olfactory loss at baseline (6)]. Patients are not always accurate in assessing their own  olfactory function and this may mean they over-estimate the extent of their recovery, self-reporting full recovery but having persistent deficits, such as parosmia or hyposmia, when objectively tested. 

Contrary to media reports, there are no widely available, validated and reliable smell tests that are quick and easy to complete – such that might be considered equivalent to a temperature check as a screening tool, so it is unlikely we will see people being asked to scratch and sniff to gain entry to their local cinema. However, even if currently available tests can be adapted to facilitate mass-screening, they would not be able to account for pre-existing olfactory loss. To deny access to airports, retails parks or equivalent settings to approximately one fifth of the population on this basis risks introducing a form of discrimination that would go beyond the potential public health benefits of reducing transmission.

The best advice that can be given at the current time is that all people who develop new onset loss of sense of smell must self-isolate and seek confirmatory testing. We should not impose punitive measures on patients who have lived and struggled without a sense of smell for many years. We encourage extreme caution in how this new finding is incorporated into policy and would suggest that clinicians and researchers working in this field be called upon first to ensure that such policies are fit for purpose.",message,

edit? <@U010LKHD4RK>:  the take home of the letter (don't use anosmia as a gatekeeper for entry to venues etc) comes very late in the letter.

Please show you support this by submitting a photo of yourself. We have enough audio clips, so just passing on your profile photo works too.

U012JJFTKNU,_usa,2020,12,08,2020-12-08,"Hello everyone, 
I’m excited to announce that the Smell and Taste Association of North America is being formed. Currently, there are no active patient organizations focused on smell and taste disorders in the United States of America. The aim of the Smell and Taste Association of North America (STANA) is to become this much-needed resource. STANA’s mission is to “provide a voice for people with smell and taste disorders through education and public awareness. We advocate for funding for research on smell and taste disorders. We collaborate with individuals living with these disorders, healthcare professionals, and institutions to provide evidence-based education, resources, and networking opportunities. We also partner with organizations around the world who are aligned with our vision to broaden our outreach.” 
STANA’s website is online at <http://www.thestana.org|www.thestana.org> and our fundraising website is <https://www.gofundme.com/f/organizing-the-smell-and-taste-association-of-na>. We are raising funds to pay for the startup costs of becoming an established 501c3 organization. If you are able to donate to help us get started, that would be much appreciated! If you are unable to donate at this time, please consider sharing the fundraising page with your networks so we can raise the funds needed to get established. 
For any questions or if you’d like to get involved, please visit <http://www.thestana.org|www.thestana.org> or email us at <mailto:info@thestana.org|info@thestana.org>.",message,
